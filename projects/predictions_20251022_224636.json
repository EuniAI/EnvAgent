Review them all below. In 2025, we have begun releasing bigger projects, like the [Serverless Container Framework](https://github.com/serverless/containers), and the [Serverless MCP](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/mcp). As always, we are more excited about the serverless future than ever.\\n\\n## New Features In V.4\\n\\nHere\\'s a list of everything that\\'s new in V.4, so far:\\n\\n- **Improved Custom Domain Support:** You no longer need an external plugin to automatically configure custom domains and SSL certificates for your APIs and more. It\\'s now built into the [Serverless Framework CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/domains).\\n- **Integration with Doppler:** You can now easily fetch Secrets from Doppler via [Serverless Framework Variables](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/doppler).\\n- **Introducing [Serverless MCP](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/mcp):** Built for Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI-powered IDEs, it auto-detects cloud resources from your code, fetching logs, state, and config from AWS, enabling you to debug serverless apps directly in your IDE — no AWS console visit needed! Supports Serverless Framework, Cloudformation, and more.\\n- **Introducing the [Serverless Container Framework](https://github.com/serverless/containers):** One solution to deploy serverless workloads everywhere - This is a new YAML file that works with the Serverless Framework CLI that gives you one experience to easily deploy containers to AWS Lambda and AWS ECS Fargate and migrate between them w/ zero-downtime — all without re-architecting. We launched this as a way to reduce large Lambda bills and give folks flexibility, but it is rapidly become the greatest developer experience for containers on AWS. Support for Google Cloud Run, Azure and more are coming soon.\\n- **Support for AWS SAM, AWS Cloudformation, & Traditional Serverless Framework Projects:** Now, you can use one tool to deploy all three of these IaC project files. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/sam)\\n- **Native Typescript Support:** You can now use `.ts` handlers in your AWS Lambda functions in `serverless.yml` and have them build automatically upon deploy. [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) is now included in the Framework which makes this possible. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/building).\\n- **The AWS AI Stack:** V.4 is optimized for [the AWS AI Stack](https://github.com/serverless/aws-ai-stack). Deploy a full-stack, serverless, boilerplate for AI applications on AWS, featuring Bedrock LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama3.1 and much more.\\n- **New Dev Mode:** Run `serverless dev` to have events from your live architecture routed to your local code, enabling you to make fast changes without deployment. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/dev).\\n- - **Node.js V22:** Support for Node.js version 22 on AWS Lambda.\\n- **New Stages Property:** Easily organize stage-specific config via `stages` and set `default` config to fallback to.\\n- **Improved Compose Experience:** Serverless Compose now has a beautiful new CLI experience that better demonstrates what is being deployed.\\n- **New Terraform & Vault Integrations:** Pull state outputs from several Terraform state storage solutions, and secrets from Vault. [Terraform Docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/terraform) [Vault Docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/vault)\\n- **Support Command:** Send support requests to our team [directly from the CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/support), which auto-include contextual info which you can review before sending.\\n- **Debug Summary for AI:** When you run into a bug, you can run \"serverless support --ai\" to generate a concise report detailing your last bug with all necessary context, optimized for pasting into AI tools such as ChatGPT.\\n- **New AWS Lambda Runtimes:** \"python3.12\", \"dotnet8\", and \"java21\".\\n- **Advanced Logging Controls for AWS Lambda:** Capture Logs in JSON, increased log granularity, and setting a custom Log Group. Here is the [AWS article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-advanced-logging-controls-for-aws-lambda-functions/). Here is the [YAML implementation](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/v4.0/docs/providers/aws/guide/serverless.yml.md#logs)\\n- **Axiom Integration:** Integrate with [Axiom\\'s observability solution](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/observability/axiom) for a powerful logging, metrics and traces experience, at 3X less than AWS cloudwatch.\\n- **AWS SSO:** Environment variables, especially ones set by AWS SSO, are prioritized. The Framework and Dashboard no longer interfere with these.\\n- **Automatic Updates:** These happen by default now. Though, you will be able to control the level of updates you\\'re open to.\\n- **Improved Onboarding & Set-Up:** The `serverless` command has been re-written to be more helpful when setting up a new or existing project.\\n- **Updated Custom Resource Handlers:** All custom resource handlers now use `nodejs20.x`.\\n- **Deprecation Of Non-AWS Providers:** Deprecation of other cloud providers, in favor of handling this better in our upcoming Serverless Framework \"Extensions\".\\n\\n## Breaking Changes\\n\\nWe\\'re seeking to avoid breaking changes for the \"aws\" Provider. However, there are a few large things that are changing to be aware of:\\n\\n- The V.4 License is changing. See the section below for more information on this.\\n- Authentication is required within the CLI.\\n- Non-AWS Providers have been deprecated. We will be introducing new ways in V.4 to use other cloud infrastructure vendors.\\n\\nIf you stumble upon additional breaking changes, please create an issue. To learn more about what\\'s different and potential breaking changes, please see our [Upgrading to Serverless Framework V4 Documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/upgrading-v4).\\n\\n## License Changes in V.4\\n\\nPlease note, the structure and licensing of the V.4 repository differ from the V.4 npm module. The npm module contains some proprietary licensed software, as V.4 transitions to a common SaaS product, [as previously announced](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-framework-v4-a-new-model). The original Serverless Framework source code and more will continue to remain MIT license software, the repository will soon be restructured to clearly distinguish between proprietary and open-source components.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n# Contents\\n\\n- [Features](#features)\\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\\n- [Examples](https://github.com/serverless/examples)\\n- [Plugins](https://github.com/serverless/plugins)\\n- [Community](#community)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n# <a name=\"features\"></a>Features\\n\\n\\nResult 2:\\nFileNode: {\\'basename\\': \\'README.md\\', \\'relative_path\\': \\'test/README.md\\', \\'node_id\\': 15}\\npreview: # How to run, organize and write tests?\\n\\nAs framework deals with significant technical debt baggage many of currently configured tests do not\\nresemble practise we want to follow in newly introduced tests.\\n\\nPlease follow this document as the only guideline, it also provides links to tests that serve as a good example to replicate\\n\\n## Unit tests\\n\\nTests are configured with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test framework, and can be run with following command\\n\\n```\\nnpm test\\n```\\n\\nAll new tests should be configured with help of [runServerless](./utils/run-serverless.js) util - it\\'s the only way to test functionality against completely intialized `serverless` instance, and it\\'s the only scenario that reflects real world usage.\\n\\nCheck documentation of `runServerless` at [@serverless/test/docs/run-serverless](https://github.com/serverless/test/blob/main/docs/run-serverless.md#run-serverless). Note that `runServerless` as configured at `./utils/run-serverless.js` supports two additional options (`fixture` and `configExt`), which provides out of a box setup to run _Serverless_ instance against prepared fixture with eventually extended service configuration\\n\\nAs `runServerless` tests are expensive, it\\'s good to ensure a _minimal_ count of `runServerless` runs to test given scope of problems. Ideally with one service example we should cover most of the test cases we can (good example of such approach is [ALB health check tests](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/80e70e7affd54418361c4d54bdef1561af6b8826/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/alb/lib/healthCheck.test.js#L18-L127))\\n\\nWhen creating a new test, it is an established practice to name the top-level describe after the path to the file, as shown in [AWS Kafka tests](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/b36cdf2db6ee25f7defe6f2c02dd40e1d5cb65c4/test/unit/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/kafka.test.js#L10).\\n\\n### Existing test examples:\\n\\n- [Run against config passed inline](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/73107822945a878abbdebe2309e8e9d87cc2858a/lib/plugins/aws/package/lib/generateCoreTemplate.test.js#L11-L14)\\n- [Run against preprepared fixture](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/74634c3317a116077a008375e20d6a5b99b1256e/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/functions/index.test.js#L2605-L2608)\\n  - Fixtures can be [extended](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/74634c3317a116077a008375e20d6a5b99b1256e/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/httpApi/index.test.js#L95-L99) on spot. Whenever possible it\\'s better to extend existing fixture (e.g. basic `function`) instead of creating new one (check [ALB health check tests](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/80e70e7affd54418361c4d54bdef1561af6b8826/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/alb/lib/healthCheck.test.js) for good example on such approach)\\n  - If needed introduce new test fixtures at [test/fixtures](./fixtures)\\n\\nExample of test files fully backed by `runServerless`:\\n\\n- [lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/httpApi.js](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/main/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/httpApi.js)\\n\\nIf we\\'re about to add new tests to an existing test file with tests written old way, then best is to create another `describe` block for new tests at the bottom (as it\\'s done [here](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/main/test/unit/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/functions.test.js#L1049))\\n\\n_Note: PR\\'s which rewrite existing tests into new method are very welcome! (but, ideally each PR should cover single test file rewrite)_\\n\\n### Coverage\\n\\nWe aim for a (near) 100% test coverage, so make sure your tests cover as much of your code as possible.\\n\\nDuring development, you can easily check coverage by running `npm run coverage`, then opening the `index.html` file inside the `coverage` directory.\\n\\n## AWS Integration tests\\n\\nRun all tests via:\\n\\n```\\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx npm run integration-test-run-all\\n```\\n\\n_Note: Home folder is mocked for test run, therefore relying on `AWS_PROFILE` won\\'t work. _ and _secret key_, need to be configured directly into env variables\\\\_\\n\\n_Note: Some integration tests depend on shared infrastructure stack (see below)_\\n\\nIdeally any feature that integrates with AWS functionality should be backed by integration test.\\n\\nCheck existing set of AWS integration tests at [test/integration](./integration)\\n\\n### Running specific integration test\\n\\nPass test file to Mocha directly as follows\\n\\n```\\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx npx mocha test/integration/{chosen}.test.js\\n```\\n\\n### Tests that depend on shared infrastructure stack\\n\\nDue to the fact that some of the tests require a bit more complex infrastructure setup which might be lengthy, two additional commands has been made available:\\n\\n- `integration-test-setup` - used for setting up all needed intrastructure dependencies\\n- `integration-test-teardown` - used for tearing down the infrastructure setup by the above command\\n\\nSuch tests take advantage of `isDependencyStackAvailable` util to check if all needed dependencies are ready. If not, it skips the given test suite.\\n\\nExamples of such tests:\\n\\n- [MSK](./integration/aws/infra-dependent/msk.test.js)\\n- [ActiveMQ](./integration/infra-dependent/active-mq.test.js)\\n- [RabbitMQ](./integration/infra-dependent/rabbit-mq.test.js)\\n- [FileSystemConfig](./integration/infra-dependent/file-system-config.test.js)\\n\\n\\nResult 3:\\nFileNode: {\\'basename\\': \\'README.md\\', \\'relative_path\\': \\'lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/api-gateway/lib/hack/README.md\\', \\'node_id\\': 23461}\\npreview: # Hack\\n\\nThis directory contains code which performs raw SDK calls rather than going through CloudFormation template compilations.\\n\\nWe\\'re planning to port the logic of these code snippets to raw CloudFormation once AWS fixes the problems currently preventing us from solely relying on CloudFormation.\\n\\n\\nResult 4:\\nFileNode: {\\'basename\\': \\'README.md\\', \\'relative_path\\': \\'lib/plugins/aws/custom-resources/resources/README.md\\', \\'node_id\\': 29883}\\npreview: # Serverless Custom CloudFormation Resources\\n\\nThis directory contains the Lambda functions for the Serverless Custom CloudFormation Resources.\\n\\n\\nResult 5:\\nFileNode: {\\'basename\\': \\'README.md\\', \\'relative_path\\': \\'docs/README.md\\', \\'node_id\\': 34210}\\npreview: <!--\\ntitle: \\'Serverless Framework Documentation\\'\\nshort_title: \\'Introduction to the Serverless Framework\\'\\ndescription: \\'An introduction to the Serverless Framework, its philosophy, overview, and key highlights.

With features like auto-scaling and no cost when idle, AWS Lambda offers a compute experience that demands so little maintenance it feels _\"serverless\"_.\\n\\nMonths later, the Serverless Framework was created to streamline the deployment of various use-cases on AWS Lambda. The Serverless Framework introduced the concept of _\"serverless architectures\"_, a transformative approach to building applications on the cloud, integrating AWS Lambda and cloud infrastructure with similar \"serverless\" qualities, to enable developers to create entire applications that scale massively with minimal maintenance.\\n\\nToday, the Serverless Framework continues to be the original, leading and most trusted tool for enterprises and start-ups building serverless architectures. Renowned Fortune 500 companies such as the _New York Times_, _Nike_, and _EA Games_ utilize it, while numerous startups have reached unicorn valuations and achieved notable exits using the Framework. These successes have been accomplished with relatively small engineering teams, leveraging the power of serverless architectures.\\n\\nThe mission of the Serverless Framework is to empower all developers to build more and manage less.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe Serverless Framework consists of a Command Line Interface and an optional Dashboard, and helps you deploy code and infrastructure together on Amazon Web Services, while increasingly supporting other cloud providers. The Framework is a YAML-based experience that uses simplified syntax to help you deploy complex infrastructure patterns easily, without needing to be a cloud expert. It is developed and maintained by Serverless Inc., a specialized software company based in San Francisco, California. Initially launched as an open-source project, the Framework has since transitioned to a SaaS product to better support its scalability and the extensive infrastructure capabilities it offers.\\n\\n## Highlights\\n\\n- **Empowerment:** Innovate faster by spending less time on infrastructure management.\\n- **Versatility:** Tackle diverse serverless use cases, from APIs and scheduled tasks to web sockets and data pipelines.\\n- **Infra & Code:** Streamline development with code and infrastructure deployment handled together.\\n- **Ease of Use:** Deploy complex applications without deep cloud infrastructure expertise, thanks to approachable YAML configuration.\\n- **Language Agnostic:** Develop in your preferred language – Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, PHP, Scala, or F# – the Framework supports them all.\\n- **Full Lifecycle:** Build, deploy, monitor, update, and troubleshoot serverless applications with ease.\\n- **Scalable Organization:** Structure large projects and teams efficiently with built-in support for stages and project composition.\\n- **Plugin Ecosystem:** Extend and modify the Framework\\'s functionality with a rich plugin ecosystem.\\n- **Vibrant Community:** Get support and connect with a passionate community of Serverless developers.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nGet started with the Serverless Framework on AWS [via this guide](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/).\\n\\nHave questions?

So you can\\'t use variables to generate dynamic logical IDs in the custom resources section for example.\\n\\n## Variable Resolvers\\n\\nVariable Resolvers allow you to reference external data sources in your serverless.yml file.\\nEach Resolver has a Provider parent, which is responsible for fetching the credentials.\\nFor example, the `aws` Provider has a `ssm` Resolver and a `s3` Resolver,\\nwhich can fetch data from AWS SSM Parameter Store and S3, respectively.\\n\\nProviders can also have default variables that can be used in the serverless.yml file,\\nsuch as `accountId` for the `aws` Provider.\\n\\nYou can customize Providers and Resolvers by specifying custom configuration options in the `resolvers` block of the `stages` section.\\nThen, you can reference the customized Resolvers using `${customProviderName:customResolverName:key}` syntax.\\n\\n**You can always reference the default Resolvers provided by Providers, even if you don’t define them explicitly.**\\nFor example,\\nyou can reference the default `s3` Resolver provided by the `aws` Provider using `${aws:s3:myBucket/myKey}` syntax\\n(it will use the AWS provider which provides the credentials for the deployment),\\nor `${customProviderName:s3:myBucket/myKey}` if you define customized Provider configuration.\\n\\n### Examples\\n\\n#### Default Resolvers\\n\\n```yaml\\nfunctions:\\n  hello:\\n    handler: handler.hello\\n    environment:\\n      ACCOUNT_ID: ${aws:accountId} # built-in variable provided by the AWS provider\\n      SSM_VALUE: ${aws:ssm:/path/to/param} # uses the default resolver configuration and the same AWS provider which is used for the deployment\\n      S3_VALUE: ${aws:s3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the default resolver configuration and the same AWS provider which is used for the deployment\\n```\\n\\n#### Customized Resolvers\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  default:\\n    resolvers:\\n      awsAccount1:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: dev-account1-profile-name\\n      awsAccount2:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: dev-account2-profile-name\\n        euS3: # custom resolver configuration defined for the awsAccount2 provider\\n          type: s3\\n          region: eu-west-1\\n  prod:\\n    resolvers:\\n      awsAccount1:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: prod-account1-profile-name\\n      awsAccount2:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: prod-account2-profile-name\\n        euS3: # custom resolver configuration defined for the awsAccount2 provider\\n          type: s3\\n          region: eu-west-1\\n\\nfunctions:\\n  hello:\\n    handler: handler.hello\\n    environment:\\n      ACCOUNT1_ID: ${awsAccount1:accountId} # built-in variable provided by the AWS provider\\n      SSM_VALUE: ${awsAccount1:ssm:/path/to/param} # uses the default resolver configuration even if it\\'s not explicitly defined in the resolvers block\\n      EU_S3_VALUE: ${awsAccount2:euS3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the customized resolver configuration\\n      S3_VALUE: ${awsAccount2:s3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the default resolver configuration even if a customized one (euS3) is defined for the same provider\\n```\\n\\n## Supported Variable Providers:\\n\\n- [Self-References Properties Defined in `serverless.yml`](./self)\\n- [Serverless Core Variables](./core)\\n- [Environment Variables](./env-vars)\\n- [CLI Options](./cli-options)\\n- [External YAML/JSON Files](./file)\\n- [Dynamic Values from Javascript](./javascript)\\n- [Git](./git)\\n- [AWS](./aws)\\n- [HashiCorp](./hashicorp)\\n\\n## Recursively reference properties\\n\\nYou can also **recursively reference properties** with the variable system. This means you can combine multiple values and variable sources for a lot of flexibility.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```yml\\nprovider:\\n  name: aws\\n  environment:\\n    MY_SECRET: ${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}\\n```\\n\\nIf `sls deploy --stage qa` is run, the stage will be set to `qa`, which is used inside the `${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}` variable and it will resolve the `config.qa.json` file and use the `CREDS` key defined.\\n\\n**How that works:**\\n\\n1. `stage` is set to `qa` from the option supplied to the `sls deploy --stage qa` command. If no option is defined, then `${sls:stage}` will use the value in `provider.stage` or default to `dev` if not set.\\n2. `${sls:stage}` resolves to `qa` and is used in `${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}`\\n3. `${file(./config.qa.json):CREDS}` is found & the `CREDS` value is read\\n4. `MY_SECRET` value is set\\n\\nLikewise, if `sls deploy --stage prod` is run the `config.prod.json` file would be found and used.\\n\\n## Setting Variables using Parameters\\n\\nOccasionally you may want to set a variable directly in the `serverless.yml` that you can use throughout the file. In such a case you can use Parameters to set new variables or use them to set stage-specific variables.\\n\\nHere is an example of setting a domain variable based on the stage:\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  default:\\n    params:\\n      domain: ${sls:stage}.example-dev.com\\n  prod:\\n    params:\\n      domain: example.com\\n\\nprovider:\\n  environment:\\n    APP_DOMAIN: ${param:domain}\\n```\\n\\nRead all about parameters in the [Parameters documentation](../../guides/parameters.md).\\n\\n## Multiple Configuration Files\\n\\nAdding many custom resources to your `serverless.yml` file could bloat the whole file, so you can use the Serverless Variable syntax to split this up.\\n\\n```yml\\nresources:\\n  Resources: ${file(cloudformation-resources.json)}\\n```\\n\\nThe corresponding resources which are defined inside the `cloudformation-resources.json` file will be resolved and loaded into the `Resources` section.\\n\\nIn order to use multiple resource files combined with resources inside the `serverless.yml` you can use an array.\\n\\n```yml\\nresources:\\n  - Resources:\\n      ApiGatewayRestApi:\\n        Type: AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi\\n\\n  - ${file(resources/first-cf-resources.yml)}\\n  - ${file(resources/second-cf-resources.yml)}\\n\\n  - Outputs:\\n      CognitoUserPoolId:\\n      Value:\\n        Ref: CognitoUserPool\\n```\\n\\nEach of your cloudformation files has to start with a `Resources` entity\\n\\n```yml\\nResources:\\n  Type: \\'AWS::S3::Bucket\\'\\n  Properties:\\n    BucketName: some-bucket-name\\n```\\n\\n## Default values\\n\\nThe Serverless framework gives you an intuitive way to reference multiple variables as a fallback strategy in case one of the variables is missing. This way you\\'ll be able to use a default value from a certain source, if the variable from another source is missing.\\n\\nFor example, you can use the `opt` variable to get the `memory` CLI option when running `serverless deploy --memory 2048`. If the `memory` option is not provided, the default value of `1024` will be used.\\n\\n```yml\\nfunctions:\\n  hello:\\n    handler: handler.hello\\n    memorySize: ${opt:memory, 1024}\\n```\\n\\nThe default value can also reference another variable.\\n\\n## Read String Variable Values as Boolean Values\\n\\nIn some cases, a parameter expect a `true` or `false` boolean value. If you are using a variable to define the value, it may return as a string (e.g. when using SSM variables) and thus return a `\"true\"` or `\"false\"` string value.\\n\\nTo ensure a boolean value is returned, read the string variable value as a boolean value. For example:\\n\\n```yml\\nprovider:\\n  tracing:\\n    apiGateway: ${strToBool(${ssm:API_GW_DEBUG_ENABLED})}\\n```\\n\\nThese are examples that explain how the conversion works after first lowercasing the passed string value:\\n\\n```plaintext\\n${strToBool(true)} => true\\n${strToBool(false)} => false\\n${strToBool(True)} => true\\n${strToBool(False)} => false\\n${strToBool(TRUE)} => true\\n${strToBool(FALSE)} => false\\n${strToBool(0)} => false\\n${strToBool(1)} => true\\n${strToBool(2)} => Error\\n${strToBool(null)} => Error\\n${strToBool(anything)} => Error\\n```\\n\\n\\nResult 13:\\nFileNode: {\\'basename\\': \\'README.md\\', \\'relative_path\\': \\'docs/guides/variables/hashicorp/README.md\\', \\'node_id\\': 34393}\\npreview: <!--\\ntitle: Serverless Framework - Variables - HashiCorp-specific variables\\ndescription: >-\\n  How to reference HashiCorp-specific variables in the Serverless Framework for\\n  efficient configuration and deployment.\\nshort_title: Serverless Variables - HashiCorp Variables\\nkeywords:\\n  - Serverless Framework\\n  - HashiCorp-specific variables\\n  - configuration\\n  - deployment\\n-->\\n\\n# Resolvers\\n\\n- [HashiCorp Terraform State Outputs](terraform)\\n- [HashiCorp Vault Secrets](vault)\\n\\n\\nResult 14:\\nFileNode: {\\'basename\\': \\'README.md\\', \\'relative_path\\': \\'docs/guides/variables/aws/README.md\\', \\'node_id\\': 34404}\\npreview: <!--\\ntitle: Serverless Framework - Variables - AWS-specific variables\\ndescription: >-\\n  How to reference AWS-specific variables in the Serverless Framework for\\n  efficient configuration and deployment.\\nshort_title: Serverless Variables - AWS Variables\\nkeywords:\\n  - Serverless Framework\\n  - AWS-specific variables\\n  - configuration\\n  - deployment\\n  - accountId\\n  - region\\n-->\\n\\n# Resolvers\\n\\n- [AWS S3](s3)\\n- [AWS SSM Parameter Store & Secrets Manager](ssm)\\n- [AWS CloudFormation Outputs](cf-stack)\\n\\n# Configuration options\\n\\n| Option            | Required |  Type   |  Default  | Description                                                          |\\n| ----------------- | :------: | :-----: | :-------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| `accessKeyId`     |    No    | String  |           | AWS Access Key ID                                                    |\\n| `secretAccessKey` |    No    | String  |           | AWS Secret Access Key                                                |\\n| `sessionToken`    |    No    | String  |           | AWS Session Token                                                    |\\n| `region`          |    No    | String  | us-east-1 | AWS region                                                           |\\n| `profile`         |    No    | String  |           | AWS profile name                                                     |\\n| `dashboard`       |    No    | Boolean |   true    | Whether Serverless Dashboard AWS Provider credentials should be used |\\n\\n## Example\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  default:\\n    resolvers:\\n      aws-account-1:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: account1-profile-name\\n        region: us-west-2\\n        accessKeyId: ${env:ACCOUNT1_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}\\n        secretAccessKey: ${env:ACCOUNT1_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}\\n        dashboard: false\\n```\\n\\n# Provider-specific variables\\n\\nYou can reference AWS-specific values as the source of your variables.

Review them all below. In 2025, we have begun releasing bigger projects, like the [Serverless Container Framework](https://github.com/serverless/containers), and the [Serverless MCP](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/mcp). As always, we are more excited about the serverless future than ever.\\n\\n## New Features In V.4\\n\\nHere\\'s a list of everything that\\'s new in V.4, so far:\\n\\n- **Improved Custom Domain Support:** You no longer need an external plugin to automatically configure custom domains and SSL certificates for your APIs and more. It\\'s now built into the [Serverless Framework CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/domains).\\n- **Integration with Doppler:** You can now easily fetch Secrets from Doppler via [Serverless Framework Variables](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/doppler).\\n- **Introducing [Serverless MCP](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/mcp):** Built for Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI-powered IDEs, it auto-detects cloud resources from your code, fetching logs, state, and config from AWS, enabling you to debug serverless apps directly in your IDE — no AWS console visit needed! Supports Serverless Framework, Cloudformation, and more.\\n- **Introducing the [Serverless Container Framework](https://github.com/serverless/containers):** One solution to deploy serverless workloads everywhere - This is a new YAML file that works with the Serverless Framework CLI that gives you one experience to easily deploy containers to AWS Lambda and AWS ECS Fargate and migrate between them w/ zero-downtime — all without re-architecting. We launched this as a way to reduce large Lambda bills and give folks flexibility, but it is rapidly become the greatest developer experience for containers on AWS. Support for Google Cloud Run, Azure and more are coming soon.\\n- **Support for AWS SAM, AWS Cloudformation, & Traditional Serverless Framework Projects:** Now, you can use one tool to deploy all three of these IaC project files. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/sam)\\n- **Native Typescript Support:** You can now use `.ts` handlers in your AWS Lambda functions in `serverless.yml` and have them build automatically upon deploy. [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) is now included in the Framework which makes this possible. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/building).\\n- **The AWS AI Stack:** V.4 is optimized for [the AWS AI Stack](https://github.com/serverless/aws-ai-stack). Deploy a full-stack, serverless, boilerplate for AI applications on AWS, featuring Bedrock LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama3.1 and much more.\\n- **New Dev Mode:** Run `serverless dev` to have events from your live architecture routed to your local code, enabling you to make fast changes without deployment. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/dev).\\n- - **Node.js V22:** Support for Node.js version 22 on AWS Lambda.\\n- **New Stages Property:** Easily organize stage-specific config via `stages` and set `default` config to fallback to.\\n- **Improved Compose Experience:** Serverless Compose now has a beautiful new CLI experience that better demonstrates what is being deployed.\\n- **New Terraform & Vault Integrations:** Pull state outputs from several Terraform state storage solutions, and secrets from Vault. [Terraform Docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/terraform) [Vault Docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/vault)\\n- **Support Command:** Send support requests to our team [directly from the CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/support), which auto-include contextual info which you can review before sending.\\n- **Debug Summary for AI:** When you run into a bug, you can run \"serverless support --ai\" to generate a concise report detailing your last bug with all necessary context, optimized for pasting into AI tools such as ChatGPT.\\n- **New AWS Lambda Runtimes:** \"python3.12\", \"dotnet8\", and \"java21\".\\n- **Advanced Logging Controls for AWS Lambda:** Capture Logs in JSON, increased log granularity, and setting a custom Log Group. Here is the [AWS article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-advanced-logging-controls-for-aws-lambda-functions/). Here is the [YAML implementation](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/v4.0/docs/providers/aws/guide/serverless.yml.md#logs)\\n- **Axiom Integration:** Integrate with [Axiom\\'s observability solution](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/observability/axiom) for a powerful logging, metrics and traces experience, at 3X less than AWS cloudwatch.\\n- **AWS SSO:** Environment variables, especially ones set by AWS SSO, are prioritized. The Framework and Dashboard no longer interfere with these.\\n- **Automatic Updates:** These happen by default now. Though, you will be able to control the level of updates you\\'re open to.\\n- **Improved Onboarding & Set-Up:** The `serverless` command has been re-written to be more helpful when setting up a new or existing project.\\n- **Updated Custom Resource Handlers:** All custom resource handlers now use `nodejs20.x`.\\n- **Deprecation Of Non-AWS Providers:** Deprecation of other cloud providers, in favor of handling this better in our upcoming Serverless Framework \"Extensions\".\\n\\n## Breaking Changes\\n\\nWe\\'re seeking to avoid breaking changes for the \"aws\" Provider. However, there are a few large things that are changing to be aware of:\\n\\n- The V.4 License is changing. See the section below for more information on this.\\n- Authentication is required within the CLI.\\n- Non-AWS Providers have been deprecated. We will be introducing new ways in V.4 to use other cloud infrastructure vendors.\\n\\nIf you stumble upon additional breaking changes, please create an issue. To learn more about what\\'s different and potential breaking changes, please see our [Upgrading to Serverless Framework V4 Documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/upgrading-v4).\\n\\n## License Changes in V.4\\n\\nPlease note, the structure and licensing of the V.4 repository differ from the V.4 npm module. The npm module contains some proprietary licensed software, as V.4 transitions to a common SaaS product, [as previously announced](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-framework-v4-a-new-model). The original Serverless Framework source code and more will continue to remain MIT license software, the repository will soon be restructured to clearly distinguish between proprietary and open-source components.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n# Contents\\n\\n- [Features](#features)\\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\\n- [Examples](https://github.com/serverless/examples)\\n- [Plugins](https://github.com/serverless/plugins)\\n- [Community](#community)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n# <a name=\"features\"></a>Features'}, {'FileNode': {'basename': 'README.md', 'relative_path': 'test/README.md', 'node_id': 15}, 'preview': \"# How to run, organize and write tests?\\n\\nAs framework deals with significant technical debt baggage many of currently configured tests do not\\nresemble practise we want to follow in newly introduced tests.\\n\\nPlease follow this document as the only guideline, it also provides links to tests that serve as a good example to replicate\\n\\n## Unit tests\\n\\nTests are configured with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test framework, and can be run with following command\\n\\n```\\nnpm test\\n```\\n\\nAll new tests should be configured with help of [runServerless](./utils/run-serverless.js) util - it's the only way to test functionality against completely intialized `serverless` instance, and it's the only scenario that reflects real world usage.\\n\\nCheck documentation of `runServerless` at [@serverless/test/docs/run-serverless](https://github.com/serverless/test/blob/main/docs/run-serverless.md#run-serverless). Note that `runServerless` as configured at `./utils/run-serverless.js` supports two additional options (`fixture` and `configExt`), which provides out of a box setup to run _Serverless_ instance against prepared fixture with eventually extended service configuration\\n\\nAs `runServerless` tests are expensive, it's good to ensure a _minimal_ count of `runServerless` runs to test given scope of problems. Ideally with one service example we should cover most of the test cases we can (good example of such approach is [ALB health check tests](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/80e70e7affd54418361c4d54bdef1561af6b8826/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/alb/lib/healthCheck.test.js#L18-L127))\\n\\nWhen creating a new test, it is an established practice to name the top-level describe after the path to the file, as shown in [AWS Kafka tests](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/b36cdf2db6ee25f7defe6f2c02dd40e1d5cb65c4/test/unit/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/kafka.test.js#L10).\\n\\n### Existing test examples:\\n\\n- [Run against config passed inline](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/73107822945a878abbdebe2309e8e9d87cc2858a/lib/plugins/aws/package/lib/generateCoreTemplate.test.js#L11-L14)\\n- [Run against preprepared fixture](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/74634c3317a116077a008375e20d6a5b99b1256e/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/functions/index.test.js#L2605-L2608)\\n  - Fixtures can be [extended](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/74634c3317a116077a008375e20d6a5b99b1256e/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/httpApi/index.test.js#L95-L99) on spot. Whenever possible it's better to extend existing fixture (e.g. basic `function`) instead of creating new one (check [ALB health check tests](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/80e70e7affd54418361c4d54bdef1561af6b8826/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/alb/lib/healthCheck.test.js) for good example on such approach)\\n  - If needed introduce new test fixtures at [test/fixtures](./fixtures)\\n\\nExample of test files fully backed by `runServerless`:\\n\\n- [lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/httpApi.js](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/main/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/httpApi.js)\\n\\nIf we're about to add new tests to an existing test file with tests written old way, then best is to create another `describe` block for new tests at the bottom (as it's done [here](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/main/test/unit/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/functions.test.js#L1049))\\n\\n_Note: PR's which rewrite existing tests into new method are very welcome! (but, ideally each PR should cover single test file rewrite)_\\n\\n### Coverage\\n\\nWe aim for a (near) 100% test coverage, so make sure your tests cover as much of your code as possible.\\n\\nDuring development, you can easily check coverage by running `npm run coverage`, then opening the `index.html` file inside the `coverage` directory.\\n\\n## AWS Integration tests\\n\\nRun all tests via:\\n\\n```\\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx npm run integration-test-run-all\\n```\\n\\n_Note: Home folder is mocked for test run, therefore relying on `AWS_PROFILE` won't work. _ and _secret key_, need to be configured directly into env variables\\\\_\\n\\n_Note: Some integration tests depend on shared infrastructure stack (see below)_\\n\\nIdeally any feature that integrates with AWS functionality should be backed by integration test.\\n\\nCheck existing set of AWS integration tests at [test/integration](./integration)\\n\\n### Running specific integration test\\n\\nPass test file to Mocha directly as follows\\n\\n```\\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx npx mocha test/integration/{chosen}.test.js\\n```\\n\\n### Tests that depend on shared infrastructure stack\\n\\nDue to the fact that some of the tests require a bit more complex infrastructure setup which might be lengthy, two additional commands has been made available:\\n\\n- `integration-test-setup` - used for setting up all needed intrastructure dependencies\\n- `integration-test-teardown` - used for tearing down the infrastructure setup by the above command\\n\\nSuch tests take advantage of `isDependencyStackAvailable` util to check if all needed dependencies are ready. If not, it skips the given test suite.\\n\\nExamples of such tests:\\n\\n- [MSK](./integration/aws/infra-dependent/msk.test.js)\\n- [ActiveMQ](./integration/infra-dependent/active-mq.test.js)\\n- [RabbitMQ](./integration/infra-dependent/rabbit-mq.test.js)\\n- [FileSystemConfig](./integration/infra-dependent/file-system-config.test.js)\"}, {'FileNode': {'basename': 'README.md', 'relative_path': 'lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/api-gateway/lib/hack/README.md', 'node_id': 23461}, 'preview': \"# Hack\\n\\nThis directory contains code which performs raw SDK calls rather than going through CloudFormation template compilations.\\n\\nWe're planning to port the logic of these code snippets to raw CloudFormation once AWS fixes the problems currently preventing us from solely relying on CloudFormation.\"}, {'FileNode': {'basename': 'README.md', 'relative_path': 'lib/plugins/aws/custom-resources/resources/README.md', 'node_id': 29883}, 'preview': '# Serverless Custom CloudFormation Resources\\n\\nThis directory contains the Lambda functions for the Serverless Custom CloudFormation Resources.'}, {'FileNode': {'basename': 'README.md', 'relative_path': 'docs/README.md', 'node_id': 34210}, 'preview': '<!--\\ntitle: \\'Serverless Framework Documentation\\'\\nshort_title: \\'Introduction to the Serverless Framework\\'\\ndescription: \\'An introduction to the Serverless Framework, its philosophy, overview, and key highlights.

With features like auto-scaling and no cost when idle, AWS Lambda offers a compute experience that demands so little maintenance it feels _\"serverless\"_.\\n\\nMonths later, the Serverless Framework was created to streamline the deployment of various use-cases on AWS Lambda. The Serverless Framework introduced the concept of _\"serverless architectures\"_, a transformative approach to building applications on the cloud, integrating AWS Lambda and cloud infrastructure with similar \"serverless\" qualities, to enable developers to create entire applications that scale massively with minimal maintenance.\\n\\nToday, the Serverless Framework continues to be the original, leading and most trusted tool for enterprises and start-ups building serverless architectures. Renowned Fortune 500 companies such as the _New York Times_, _Nike_, and _EA Games_ utilize it, while numerous startups have reached unicorn valuations and achieved notable exits using the Framework. These successes have been accomplished with relatively small engineering teams, leveraging the power of serverless architectures.\\n\\nThe mission of the Serverless Framework is to empower all developers to build more and manage less.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe Serverless Framework consists of a Command Line Interface and an optional Dashboard, and helps you deploy code and infrastructure together on Amazon Web Services, while increasingly supporting other cloud providers. The Framework is a YAML-based experience that uses simplified syntax to help you deploy complex infrastructure patterns easily, without needing to be a cloud expert. It is developed and maintained by Serverless Inc., a specialized software company based in San Francisco, California. Initially launched as an open-source project, the Framework has since transitioned to a SaaS product to better support its scalability and the extensive infrastructure capabilities it offers.\\n\\n## Highlights\\n\\n- **Empowerment:** Innovate faster by spending less time on infrastructure management.\\n- **Versatility:** Tackle diverse serverless use cases, from APIs and scheduled tasks to web sockets and data pipelines.\\n- **Infra & Code:** Streamline development with code and infrastructure deployment handled together.\\n- **Ease of Use:** Deploy complex applications without deep cloud infrastructure expertise, thanks to approachable YAML configuration.\\n- **Language Agnostic:** Develop in your preferred language – Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, PHP, Scala, or F# – the Framework supports them all.\\n- **Full Lifecycle:** Build, deploy, monitor, update, and troubleshoot serverless applications with ease.\\n- **Scalable Organization:** Structure large projects and teams efficiently with built-in support for stages and project composition.\\n- **Plugin Ecosystem:** Extend and modify the Framework\\'s functionality with a rich plugin ecosystem.\\n- **Vibrant Community:** Get support and connect with a passionate community of Serverless developers.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nGet started with the Serverless Framework on AWS [via this guide](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/).\\n\\nHave questions?

So you can\\'t use variables to generate dynamic logical IDs in the custom resources section for example.\\n\\n## Variable Resolvers\\n\\nVariable Resolvers allow you to reference external data sources in your serverless.yml file.\\nEach Resolver has a Provider parent, which is responsible for fetching the credentials.\\nFor example, the `aws` Provider has a `ssm` Resolver and a `s3` Resolver,\\nwhich can fetch data from AWS SSM Parameter Store and S3, respectively.\\n\\nProviders can also have default variables that can be used in the serverless.yml file,\\nsuch as `accountId` for the `aws` Provider.\\n\\nYou can customize Providers and Resolvers by specifying custom configuration options in the `resolvers` block of the `stages` section.\\nThen, you can reference the customized Resolvers using `${customProviderName:customResolverName:key}` syntax.\\n\\n**You can always reference the default Resolvers provided by Providers, even if you don’t define them explicitly.**\\nFor example,\\nyou can reference the default `s3` Resolver provided by the `aws` Provider using `${aws:s3:myBucket/myKey}` syntax\\n(it will use the AWS provider which provides the credentials for the deployment),\\nor `${customProviderName:s3:myBucket/myKey}` if you define customized Provider configuration.\\n\\n### Examples\\n\\n#### Default Resolvers\\n\\n```yaml\\nfunctions:\\n  hello:\\n    handler: handler.hello\\n    environment:\\n      ACCOUNT_ID: ${aws:accountId} # built-in variable provided by the AWS provider\\n      SSM_VALUE: ${aws:ssm:/path/to/param} # uses the default resolver configuration and the same AWS provider which is used for the deployment\\n      S3_VALUE: ${aws:s3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the default resolver configuration and the same AWS provider which is used for the deployment\\n```\\n\\n#### Customized Resolvers\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  default:\\n    resolvers:\\n      awsAccount1:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: dev-account1-profile-name\\n      awsAccount2:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: dev-account2-profile-name\\n        euS3: # custom resolver configuration defined for the awsAccount2 provider\\n          type: s3\\n          region: eu-west-1\\n  prod:\\n    resolvers:\\n      awsAccount1:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: prod-account1-profile-name\\n      awsAccount2:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: prod-account2-profile-name\\n        euS3: # custom resolver configuration defined for the awsAccount2 provider\\n          type: s3\\n          region: eu-west-1\\n\\nfunctions:\\n  hello:\\n    handler: handler.hello\\n    environment:\\n      ACCOUNT1_ID: ${awsAccount1:accountId} # built-in variable provided by the AWS provider\\n      SSM_VALUE: ${awsAccount1:ssm:/path/to/param} # uses the default resolver configuration even if it\\'s not explicitly defined in the resolvers block\\n      EU_S3_VALUE: ${awsAccount2:euS3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the customized resolver configuration\\n      S3_VALUE: ${awsAccount2:s3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the default resolver configuration even if a customized one (euS3) is defined for the same provider\\n```\\n\\n## Supported Variable Providers:\\n\\n- [Self-References Properties Defined in `serverless.yml`](./self)\\n- [Serverless Core Variables](./core)\\n- [Environment Variables](./env-vars)\\n- [CLI Options](./cli-options)\\n- [External YAML/JSON Files](./file)\\n- [Dynamic Values from Javascript](./javascript)\\n- [Git](./git)\\n- [AWS](./aws)\\n- [HashiCorp](./hashicorp)\\n\\n## Recursively reference properties\\n\\nYou can also **recursively reference properties** with the variable system. This means you can combine multiple values and variable sources for a lot of flexibility.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```yml\\nprovider:\\n  name: aws\\n  environment:\\n    MY_SECRET: ${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}\\n```\\n\\nIf `sls deploy --stage qa` is run, the stage will be set to `qa`, which is used inside the `${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}` variable and it will resolve the `config.qa.json` file and use the `CREDS` key defined.\\n\\n**How that works:**\\n\\n1. `stage` is set to `qa` from the option supplied to the `sls deploy --stage qa` command. If no option is defined, then `${sls:stage}` will use the value in `provider.stage` or default to `dev` if not set.\\n2. `${sls:stage}` resolves to `qa` and is used in `${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}`\\n3. `${file(./config.qa.json):CREDS}` is found & the `CREDS` value is read\\n4. `MY_SECRET` value is set\\n\\nLikewise, if `sls deploy --stage prod` is run the `config.prod.json` file would be found and used.\\n\\n## Setting Variables using Parameters\\n\\nOccasionally you may want to set a variable directly in the `serverless.yml` that you can use throughout the file. In such a case you can use Parameters to set new variables or use them to set stage-specific variables.\\n\\nHere is an example of setting a domain variable based on the stage:\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  default:\\n    params:\\n      domain: ${sls:stage}.example-dev.com\\n  prod:\\n    params:\\n      domain: example.com\\n\\nprovider:\\n  environment:\\n    APP_DOMAIN: ${param:domain}\\n```\\n\\nRead all about parameters in the [Parameters documentation](../../guides/parameters.md).\\n\\n## Multiple Configuration Files\\n\\nAdding many custom resources to your `serverless.yml` file could bloat the whole file, so you can use the Serverless Variable syntax to split this up.\\n\\n```yml\\nresources:\\n  Resources: ${file(cloudformation-resources.json)}\\n```\\n\\nThe corresponding resources which are defined inside the `cloudformation-resources.json` file will be resolved and loaded into the `Resources` section.\\n\\nIn order to use multiple resource files combined with resources inside the `serverless.yml` you can use an array.\\n\\n```yml\\nresources:\\n  - Resources:\\n      ApiGatewayRestApi:\\n        Type: AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi\\n\\n  - ${file(resources/first-cf-resources.yml)}\\n  - ${file(resources/second-cf-resources.yml)}\\n\\n  - Outputs:\\n      CognitoUserPoolId:\\n      Value:\\n        Ref: CognitoUserPool\\n```\\n\\nEach of your cloudformation files has to start with a `Resources` entity\\n\\n```yml\\nResources:\\n  Type: \\'AWS::S3::Bucket\\'\\n  Properties:\\n    BucketName: some-bucket-name\\n```\\n\\n## Default values\\n\\nThe Serverless framework gives you an intuitive way to reference multiple variables as a fallback strategy in case one of the variables is missing. This way you\\'ll be able to use a default value from a certain source, if the variable from another source is missing.\\n\\nFor example, you can use the `opt` variable to get the `memory` CLI option when running `serverless deploy --memory 2048`. If the `memory` option is not provided, the default value of `1024` will be used.\\n\\n```yml\\nfunctions:\\n  hello:\\n    handler: handler.hello\\n    memorySize: ${opt:memory, 1024}\\n```\\n\\nThe default value can also reference another variable.\\n\\n## Read String Variable Values as Boolean Values\\n\\nIn some cases, a parameter expect a `true` or `false` boolean value. If you are using a variable to define the value, it may return as a string (e.g. when using SSM variables) and thus return a `\"true\"` or `\"false\"` string value.\\n\\nTo ensure a boolean value is returned, read the string variable value as a boolean value. For example:\\n\\n```yml\\nprovider:\\n  tracing:\\n    apiGateway: ${strToBool(${ssm:API_GW_DEBUG_ENABLED})}\\n```\\n\\nThese are examples that explain how the conversion works after first lowercasing the passed string value:\\n\\n```plaintext\\n${strToBool(true)} => true\\n${strToBool(false)} => false\\n${strToBool(True)} => true\\n${strToBool(False)} => false\\n${strToBool(TRUE)} => true\\n${strToBool(FALSE)} => false\\n${strToBool(0)} => false\\n${strToBool(1)} => true\\n${strToBool(2)} => Error\\n${strToBool(null)} => Error\\n${strToBool(anything)} => Error\\n```'}, {'FileNode': {'basename': 'README.md', 'relative_path': 'docs/guides/variables/hashicorp/README.md', 'node_id': 34393}, 'preview': '<!--\\ntitle: Serverless Framework - Variables - HashiCorp-specific variables\\ndescription: >-\\n  How to reference HashiCorp-specific variables in the Serverless Framework for\\n  efficient configuration and deployment.\\nshort_title: Serverless Variables - HashiCorp Variables\\nkeywords:\\n  - Serverless Framework\\n  - HashiCorp-specific variables\\n  - configuration\\n  - deployment\\n-->\\n\\n# Resolvers\\n\\n- [HashiCorp Terraform State Outputs](terraform)\\n- [HashiCorp Vault Secrets](vault)'}, {'FileNode': {'basename': 'README.md', 'relative_path': 'docs/guides/variables/aws/README.md', 'node_id': 34404}, 'preview': '<!--\\ntitle: Serverless Framework - Variables - AWS-specific variables\\ndescription: >-\\n  How to reference AWS-specific variables in the Serverless Framework for\\n  efficient configuration and deployment.\\nshort_title: Serverless Variables - AWS Variables\\nkeywords:\\n  - Serverless Framework\\n  - AWS-specific variables\\n  - configuration\\n  - deployment\\n  - accountId\\n  - region\\n-->\\n\\n# Resolvers\\n\\n- [AWS S3](s3)\\n- [AWS SSM Parameter Store & Secrets Manager](ssm)\\n- [AWS CloudFormation Outputs](cf-stack)\\n\\n# Configuration options\\n\\n| Option            | Required |  Type   |  Default  | Description                                                          |\\n| ----------------- | :------: | :-----: | :-------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| `accessKeyId`     |    No    | String  |           | AWS Access Key ID                                                    |\\n| `secretAccessKey` |    No    | String  |           | AWS Secret Access Key                                                |\\n| `sessionToken`    |    No    | String  |           | AWS Session Token                                                    |\\n| `region`          |    No    | String  | us-east-1 | AWS region                                                           |\\n| `profile`         |    No    | String  |           | AWS profile name                                                     |\\n| `dashboard`       |    No    | Boolean |   true    | Whether Serverless Dashboard AWS Provider credentials should be used |\\n\\n## Example\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  default:\\n    resolvers:\\n      aws-account-1:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: account1-profile-name\\n        region: us-west-2\\n        accessKeyId: ${env:ACCOUNT1_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}\\n        secretAccessKey: ${env:ACCOUNT1_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}\\n        dashboard: false\\n```\\n\\n# Provider-specific variables\\n\\nYou can reference AWS-specific values as the source of your variables.

We hope it\\'s a breath of fresh air compared to the complexity of interacting with the AWS Console across several accounts, directly.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n- **Deployments:** Easily see all Serverless Framework deployments made by you and your team, via CI/CD or local installations of the CLI, across all of your AWS accounts, in one place. Quickly check who made the deployment, what the status is, how it may have failed, see git metadata, serverless.yml, outputs, and much more.\\n\\n- **Secrets:** Set and share secrets in one place, for use within your Serverless Framework `serverless.yml` files. This works across all AWS accounts, so it\\'s ideal for making secrets easy to use without wrestling with AWS permissions to access them. Secrets are encrypted and secure by default.\\n\\n- **Observability:** The richest and slickest observability solution for AWS Lambda on the market. We\\'ve spent years crafting an observability solution that developers love, specializing in AWS Lambda. Set-up requires zero effort and you will instantly get rich Metrics, Traces, Logs and Alerts, just deploy with the Serverless Framework. The Observability features also support non-Serverless Framework deployed AWS Lambda functions. Simply connect your AWS accounts and you\\'ll be able to instrument all of the AWS Lambda functions in them.\\n\\n- **Providers:** Providers make it easy to manage deployment access to your AWS accounts. Each Provider connects to 1 AWS account, and you can assign it to specific Services, Stages, or set a Provider as a default across an entire AWS account. This enables your team to never have to deal with local AWS credentials. Providers use an AWS IAM Role to connect to your account and provide short-term credentials for every deployment, which is more secure by default.\\n\\n- **CI/CD:** CI/CD optimized for Serverless Framework that works out-of-the-box. Simply connect it to Github or BitBucket to enable automated deployments. Set up preview deployments for branches, and much more.\\n\\n## Minimum Version Requirements\\n\\nTo use Serverless Framework Dashboard, you must be using Serverless Framework CLI version 1.48.0 or later.\\n\\nFor Serverless Framework\\'s new Observability offering, you must use version 3.35.0 or later.\\n\\n## Set-Up\\n\\nIf you don\\'t already have a Serverless Framework account, create a new account at [https://app.serverless.com](https://app.serverless.com).\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have existing Serverless Framework Services, follow the [Getting Started with the Serverless Framework and AWS](../../getting-started.md) guide. This will help you get a Serverless Framework Service deployed to AWS, and enabled with the Dashboard.\\n\\nIf you have existing Serverless Framework Services, in the directory with your Service\\'s `serverless.yml` file, run the `serverless` command. This will walk you through the setup process, including setting up your AWS account credentials and creating an organization and application from the Dashboard. Once completed, you\\'ll notice that the `org` and `app` fields will be added to your `serverless.yml` to indicate the org/app to which this service belongs.\\n\\nYou can also add the configuration manually to your `serverless.yml` files within your Serverless Framework Services to connect to the Dashboard.\\n\\n```YAML\\n\\norg: # Your Serverless Framework Org name (e.g. acme-inc)\\napp: # A parent namespce for this Service and related Services App name (e.g. mobile-app), to improve Serverless Framework Dashboard organization\\n\\n```\\n\\nYou must deploy your Service with the above configuration in your YAML file to have it show in the Dashboard. Run serverless deploy to do this.\\n\\nIf you want to enable Observability (metrics, traces, logs) for your AWS Lambda functions within Serverless Framework Dashboard, you will have to add the following in the stages block of your serverless.yml:\\n\\n```yml\\nstages:\\n  prod:\\n    observability: true # turn on observability in the \"prod\" Stage.\\n  dev:\\n    observability: true # turn on observability in the \"dev\" Stage.\\n  default:\\n    observability: false # turn off observability for all other Stages.\\n```\\n\\nTo set up Observability, Serverless Framework will automatically create an AWS IAM Role within the AWS account you deployed to, giving Serverless Inc permission to AWS Cloudwatch and more.

This launches a quick process that opens a new browser window containing AWS Console\\'s AWS CloudFormation Stack Create view. This window is pre-loaded with an AWS CloudFormation Stack Template that contains an AWS IAM Role with all of the permissions Serverless Framework\\'s Monitoring & Observability features need. At the bottom of this page, click \"Create\".\\n\\nWhile the CloudFormation Stack is creating, go back to the Serverless Framework Dashboard. The Integration view should have detected your Stack is being created and this view will continue to update in real-time until the integration is completed. No other steps are required on your behalf.\\n\\nRepeat this step to connect as many AWS accounts that you\\'d like to enable Monitoring & Observability for.\\n\\nOnce an AWS account is connected, you will need to choose the AWS Lambda functions you wish to enable Monitoring & Observability on. You should see a newly created AWS Integration in the \"Integrations\" view. We recommend giving that AWS Account a name (e.g. \"production\", \"development\") so it\\'s easier to remember and find in Dashboard\\'s query filters. On the Integration, click the \"Edit\" button, and you will see all of the AWS Lambda functions within that AWS account.\\n\\nClick the \"Instrument\" toggle on individual AWS Lambda functions, or click the toggle in the table header to enable instrumentation on all of the functions within that page (you\\'ll have to repeat this on each page if you have multiple pages of AWS Lambda functions). Click \"Save\". This will instrument the AWS Lambda functions in the background. You can go through each page and continue to instrument AWS Lambda functions since instrumentation happens asynchronously.\\n\\nGo to the Metrics or Explorer view. Make sure your AWS Lambda functions are being invoked. After a few minutes, you should see data appear.\\n\\nPlease note, Metrics, Traces and more typically can take up to 10 minutes before they are visible in Serverless Framework Dashboard, after an AWS account has been integrated.\\n\\n### Set-Up Via Serverless Framework CLI\\n\\nYou can use the Serverless Framework CLI to enable Monitoring & Observability. This approach will automatically connect the Serverless Framework Platform to an AWS account and enable monitoring on all of the AWS Lambda functions for the selected stages within the Serverless Framework Service.\\n\\nHowever, if you want to connect multiple AWS accounts and/or enable monitoring on all AWS Lambda functions within an AWS account, setting it up via the Serverless Framework Dashboard UI is more convenient, as you can accomplish this in a few clicks.\\n\\nWithin the working directory of a Serverless Framework Service, ensure the Service is first connected to the Serverless Framework Dashboard. This can be confirmed by the presence of an org and app properties within the serverless.yml file. If the Service is not connected to the Dashboard, run the `serverless` command within the working directory of the Serverless Framework Service. Once your service is connected to the Serverless Dashboard, you can control your observability instrumentation settings under the stages property in your serverless.yml file:\\n\\n```yml\\n# Ensure these properties are present to connect to the Dashboard\\norg: my-org\\napp: my-app\\n\\n# Control observability instrumentation settings under stages\\nstages:\\n  dev:\\n    observability: true # Turn on observability in the dev stage\\n  prod:\\n    observability: true # Turn on observability in the prod stage\\n  default:\\n    observability: false # Turn off observability in all other stages\\n```\\n\\nNow, whenever you deploy, observability will be enabled or disabled according to the stage you are deploying to. In the above example, observability will be enabled in the dev and prod stages but disabled in all other stages.\\n\\nAfter deployment, confirm everything worked within the Serverless Framework Dashboard. Go to \"Settings\" > \"Integrations,\" and you should see the AWS account that was recently integrated. We highly recommend giving that account a name so it\\'s easier to remember and find in the Dashboard\\'s query filters.\\n\\nIf you click on the \"Edit\" button on that Integration, you should see all of the AWS Lambda functions in the account, indicating which ones are enabled and which are disabled.\\n\\nPlease note, Metrics, Traces and more typically can take up to 10 minutes before they are visible in Serverless Framework Dashboard, after an AWS account has been integrated.\\n\\n## Advanced Instrumentation Using The SDK\\n\\nIn addition to the out-of-the-box instrumentation provided by Serverless Framework Dashboard, you can customize instrumentation using the Serverless SDK for richer use cases, such as:\\n\\n- Capturing handled errors so that they are reported elegantly in Serverless Framework Dashboard.\\n- Capturing custom Trace Spans.\\n- Capturing Error and Warnings Events.\\n- Adding Custom Tags to Traces for better searchability.\\n- Integrating with structured logging libraries.\\n\\nSee the SDK documentation for Node and Python for details:\\n\\n- [Full NodeJS Documentation](./sdk/nodejs.md)\\n- [Full Python Documentation](./sdk/python.md)\\n\\n## Supported AWS Lambda Runtimes\\n\\nServerless Framework\\'s Monitoring & Observability features currently support the following AWS Lambda Runtimes:\\n\\n- nodejs14.x\\n- nodejs16.x\\n- nodejs18.x\\n- python3.8\\n- python3.9\\n- python3.10\\n- python3.11\\n\\n## Supported AWS Regions\\n\\nServerless Framework\\'s Monitoring & Observability features currently support all of the Commercial AWS Regions. They do not support GovCloud or reginos in China.\\n\\n## How Integration Works\\n\\nServerless Framework\\'s Monitoring & Observability features use a few approaches to thoroughly collect all Metrics, Traces, Errors and more from your AWS Lambda functions. This is all done via an AWS IAM Role that is created when you integrate your AWS account with Serverless Framework\\'s Platform. The permissions for this AWS IAM Role are kept in [Github here](https://github.com/serverless/dashboard), so that you can easily review what\\'s required. You can remove this IAM Role at any time. But we recommend hitting \"Remove\" on the Integration within the Dashboard because it will automatically un-instrument the AWS account and AWS Lambda functions, in addition to deleting the IAM Role.\\n\\nThe first thing an AWS account integration does is create a Kinesis Firehose within your AWS account connected to a Cloudwatch Logs Subscription to each of your AWS Lambda functions which publish logs into that Firehose. The Serverless Framework Platform ingests log data from that Kinesis Firehose. This helps us collect Logs and more from your AWS Lambda functions. During each invocation, the Serverless Framework logs a compressed payload containing Trace information within your AWS Cloudwatch Logs. This can be identified easily because it starts with `SERVERLESS_TELEMETRY`.'}, {'FileNode': {'basename': 'README.md', 'relative_path': 'docs/guides/dashboard/monitoring/sdk/README.md', 'node_id': 34456}, 'preview': \"<!--\\ntitle: Serverless Framework - Monitoring & Observability - SDKs\\ndescription: Learn how to use the Serverless Framework SDK for monitoring and observability in your serverless applications.\\nshort_title: Serverless Observability - SDK\\nkeywords:\\n  [\\n    'Serverless Framework',\\n    'SDK',\\n    'Monitoring',\\n    'Observability',\\n    'Lambda',\\n    'Instrumentation',\\n  ]\\n-->\\n\\n<!-- DOCS-SITE-LINK:START automatically generated  -->\\n\\n### [Read this on the main serverless docs site](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/sdk/)\\n\\n<!-- DOCS-SITE-LINK:END -->\\n\\n# Serverless Framework SDK\\n\\nWhen using the Serverless Framework Dashboard, the Framework automatically injects the `serverless_sdk` module into your lambda package and wraps your lambda to automatically instrument all the monitoring features in the Dashboard.\\n\\nIt also has certain features you can use directly in your lambda such as capturing an error in the Dashboard without causing your lambda to error and custom function spans.\\n\\n[NodeJS Documentation](./nodejs.md)\\n\\n[Python Documentation](./python.md)\\n\\n## Advanced Span Configuration\\n\\nFor most of the SDK configuration, like turning on/off span collection, follow the\\n[Monitoring Configuration](../README.md/#configuration) instructions to modify your\\nserverless.yml appropriately.\\n\\nIf needed, you can configure HTTP span collection with the following environment variables\\n\\n- `SERVERLESS_ENTERPRISE_SPANS_CAPTURE_HOSTS` - `*` by default.

Currently Github and BitBucket are supported as a VCS providers. Your project, including the serverless.yml file, must be checked into a repo.\\n2. **Must be deployed on AWS**. The dashboard currently only supports AWS as a cloud service provider. Other cloud service providers are a work in progress.\\n3. **Must use the Node or Python runtime**. Currently only Serverless Framework projects using the Node or Python runtimes are supported. Other runtimes may work but are not officially supported.\\n\\n## Getting Started in 3 steps\\n\\n### Step 1: Link your AWS Account\\n\\nAs is the case with deployments from the Serverless Framework CLI, Serverless CI/CD requires access to your AWS Account in order to deploy your services. To make this process as secure as possible, Serverless CI/CD will generate short-lived credentials to your AWS account on each deployment. This is done by creating an AWS Access Role in your AWS account and associating it with a Provider in the Serverless Framework Dashboard.\\n\\nIf you’ve already set up an AWS Access Role with a Provider, you can skip this step. Otherwise, please go through the instructions on our [Provider documentation page](../dashboard/providers.md) to help set one up.\\n\\n### Step 2: Connect to Github\\n\\n1. Login to [https://app.serverless.com/](https://app.serverless.com/).\\n2. Navigate to the app which contains the service you want to deploy and click the menu icon (...) on the right hand side and choose \"settings\"\\n3. In the “connect to git” section, click “connect to Github” or \"connect to BitBucket\" and follow the instructions to authenticate and install the Serverless Framework app.\\n4. In the “repository settings” section, select the repository and base directory if needed containing your service. The service name specified in the serverless.yml must match the service you are configuring.\\n5. In the \"branch deploys\" section, you can choose to map a specific branch in your repo to the correct stage. When code is merged to that branch it then deploys using that stage and its associated Provider (and parameters).\\n6. Changes will be automatically saved when you make them\\n\\nThat’s it! You do not have to create any configuration files in your repository or define your test commands or your\\ndeployment commands.\\n\\nYour service will now deploy from the master branch and you’ll see all the test results, logs, safeguard pass/fail\\nstatus, and deployment details.\\n\\n### Step 3: Deploy from a Github branch\\n\\nNow that you are setup to deploy all changes to the master branch to the dev stage for your service, go ahead and make a\\ncommit and navigate to “deployments” in the dashboard. You will be able to see the new test and deployment.'}]",

Review them all below. In 2025, we have begun releasing bigger projects, like the [Serverless Container Framework](https://github.com/serverless/containers), and the [Serverless MCP](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/mcp). As always, we are more excited about the serverless future than ever.\\n\\n## New Features In V.4\\n\\nHere\\'s a list of everything that\\'s new in V.4, so far:\\n\\n- **Improved Custom Domain Support:** You no longer need an external plugin to automatically configure custom domains and SSL certificates for your APIs and more. It\\'s now built into the [Serverless Framework CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/domains).\\n- **Integration with Doppler:** You can now easily fetch Secrets from Doppler via [Serverless Framework Variables](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/doppler).\\n- **Introducing [Serverless MCP](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/mcp):** Built for Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI-powered IDEs, it auto-detects cloud resources from your code, fetching logs, state, and config from AWS, enabling you to debug serverless apps directly in your IDE — no AWS console visit needed! Supports Serverless Framework, Cloudformation, and more.\\n- **Introducing the [Serverless Container Framework](https://github.com/serverless/containers):** One solution to deploy serverless workloads everywhere - This is a new YAML file that works with the Serverless Framework CLI that gives you one experience to easily deploy containers to AWS Lambda and AWS ECS Fargate and migrate between them w/ zero-downtime — all without re-architecting. We launched this as a way to reduce large Lambda bills and give folks flexibility, but it is rapidly become the greatest developer experience for containers on AWS. Support for Google Cloud Run, Azure and more are coming soon.\\n- **Support for AWS SAM, AWS Cloudformation, & Traditional Serverless Framework Projects:** Now, you can use one tool to deploy all three of these IaC project files. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/sam)\\n- **Native Typescript Support:** You can now use `.ts` handlers in your AWS Lambda functions in `serverless.yml` and have them build automatically upon deploy. [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) is now included in the Framework which makes this possible. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/building).\\n- **The AWS AI Stack:** V.4 is optimized for [the AWS AI Stack](https://github.com/serverless/aws-ai-stack). Deploy a full-stack, serverless, boilerplate for AI applications on AWS, featuring Bedrock LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama3.1 and much more.\\n- **New Dev Mode:** Run `serverless dev` to have events from your live architecture routed to your local code, enabling you to make fast changes without deployment. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/dev).\\n- - **Node.js V22:** Support for Node.js version 22 on AWS Lambda.\\n- **New Stages Property:** Easily organize stage-specific config via `stages` and set `default` config to fallback to.\\n- **Improved Compose Experience:** Serverless Compose now has a beautiful new CLI experience that better demonstrates what is being deployed.\\n- **New Terraform & Vault Integrations:** Pull state outputs from several Terraform state storage solutions, and secrets from Vault. [Terraform Docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/terraform) [Vault Docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/vault)\\n- **Support Command:** Send support requests to our team [directly from the CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/support), which auto-include contextual info which you can review before sending.\\n- **Debug Summary for AI:** When you run into a bug, you can run \"serverless support --ai\" to generate a concise report detailing your last bug with all necessary context, optimized for pasting into AI tools such as ChatGPT.\\n- **New AWS Lambda Runtimes:** \"python3.12\", \"dotnet8\", and \"java21\".\\n- **Advanced Logging Controls for AWS Lambda:** Capture Logs in JSON, increased log granularity, and setting a custom Log Group. Here is the [AWS article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-advanced-logging-controls-for-aws-lambda-functions/). Here is the [YAML implementation](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/v4.0/docs/providers/aws/guide/serverless.yml.md#logs)\\n- **Axiom Integration:** Integrate with [Axiom\\'s observability solution](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/observability/axiom) for a powerful logging, metrics and traces experience, at 3X less than AWS cloudwatch.\\n- **AWS SSO:** Environment variables, especially ones set by AWS SSO, are prioritized. The Framework and Dashboard no longer interfere with these.\\n- **Automatic Updates:** These happen by default now. Though, you will be able to control the level of updates you\\'re open to.\\n- **Improved Onboarding & Set-Up:** The `serverless` command has been re-written to be more helpful when setting up a new or existing project.\\n- **Updated Custom Resource Handlers:** All custom resource handlers now use `nodejs20.x`.\\n- **Deprecation Of Non-AWS Providers:** Deprecation of other cloud providers, in favor of handling this better in our upcoming Serverless Framework \"Extensions\".\\n\\n## Breaking Changes\\n\\nWe\\'re seeking to avoid breaking changes for the \"aws\" Provider. However, there are a few large things that are changing to be aware of:\\n\\n- The V.4 License is changing. See the section below for more information on this.\\n- Authentication is required within the CLI.\\n- Non-AWS Providers have been deprecated. We will be introducing new ways in V.4 to use other cloud infrastructure vendors.\\n\\nIf you stumble upon additional breaking changes, please create an issue. To learn more about what\\'s different and potential breaking changes, please see our [Upgrading to Serverless Framework V4 Documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/upgrading-v4).\\n\\n## License Changes in V.4\\n\\nPlease note, the structure and licensing of the V.4 repository differ from the V.4 npm module. The npm module contains some proprietary licensed software, as V.4 transitions to a common SaaS product, [as previously announced](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-framework-v4-a-new-model). The original Serverless Framework source code and more will continue to remain MIT license software, the repository will soon be restructured to clearly distinguish between proprietary and open-source components.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n# Contents\\n\\n- [Features](#features)\\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\\n- [Examples](https://github.com/serverless/examples)\\n- [Plugins](https://github.com/serverless/plugins)\\n- [Community](#community)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n# <a name=\"features\"></a>Features\\n\\n\\nResult 2:\\nFileNode: {\\'basename\\': \\'README.md\\', \\'relative_path\\': \\'test/README.md\\', \\'node_id\\': 15}\\npreview: # How to run, organize and write tests?\\n\\nAs framework deals with significant technical debt baggage many of currently configured tests do not\\nresemble practise we want to follow in newly introduced tests.\\n\\nPlease follow this document as the only guideline, it also provides links to tests that serve as a good example to replicate\\n\\n## Unit tests\\n\\nTests are configured with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test framework, and can be run with following command\\n\\n```\\nnpm test\\n```\\n\\nAll new tests should be configured with help of [runServerless](./utils/run-serverless.js) util - it\\'s the only way to test functionality against completely intialized `serverless` instance, and it\\'s the only scenario that reflects real world usage.\\n\\nCheck documentation of `runServerless` at [@serverless/test/docs/run-serverless](https://github.com/serverless/test/blob/main/docs/run-serverless.md#run-serverless). Note that `runServerless` as configured at `./utils/run-serverless.js` supports two additional options (`fixture` and `configExt`), which provides out of a box setup to run _Serverless_ instance against prepared fixture with eventually extended service configuration\\n\\nAs `runServerless` tests are expensive, it\\'s good to ensure a _minimal_ count of `runServerless` runs to test given scope of problems. Ideally with one service example we should cover most of the test cases we can (good example of such approach is [ALB health check tests](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/80e70e7affd54418361c4d54bdef1561af6b8826/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/alb/lib/healthCheck.test.js#L18-L127))\\n\\nWhen creating a new test, it is an established practice to name the top-level describe after the path to the file, as shown in [AWS Kafka tests](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/b36cdf2db6ee25f7defe6f2c02dd40e1d5cb65c4/test/unit/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/kafka.test.js#L10).\\n\\n### Existing test examples:\\n\\n- [Run against config passed inline](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/73107822945a878abbdebe2309e8e9d87cc2858a/lib/plugins/aws/package/lib/generateCoreTemplate.test.js#L11-L14)\\n- [Run against preprepared fixture](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/74634c3317a116077a008375e20d6a5b99b1256e/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/functions/index.test.js#L2605-L2608)\\n  - Fixtures can be [extended](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/74634c3317a116077a008375e20d6a5b99b1256e/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/httpApi/index.test.js#L95-L99) on spot.

With features like auto-scaling and no cost when idle, AWS Lambda offers a compute experience that demands so little maintenance it feels _\"serverless\"_.\\n\\nMonths later, the Serverless Framework was created to streamline the deployment of various use-cases on AWS Lambda. The Serverless Framework introduced the concept of _\"serverless architectures\"_, a transformative approach to building applications on the cloud, integrating AWS Lambda and cloud infrastructure with similar \"serverless\" qualities, to enable developers to create entire applications that scale massively with minimal maintenance.\\n\\nToday, the Serverless Framework continues to be the original, leading and most trusted tool for enterprises and start-ups building serverless architectures. Renowned Fortune 500 companies such as the _New York Times_, _Nike_, and _EA Games_ utilize it, while numerous startups have reached unicorn valuations and achieved notable exits using the Framework. These successes have been accomplished with relatively small engineering teams, leveraging the power of serverless architectures.\\n\\nThe mission of the Serverless Framework is to empower all developers to build more and manage less.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe Serverless Framework consists of a Command Line Interface and an optional Dashboard, and helps you deploy code and infrastructure together on Amazon Web Services, while increasingly supporting other cloud providers. The Framework is a YAML-based experience that uses simplified syntax to help you deploy complex infrastructure patterns easily, without needing to be a cloud expert. It is developed and maintained by Serverless Inc., a specialized software company based in San Francisco, California. Initially launched as an open-source project, the Framework has since transitioned to a SaaS product to better support its scalability and the extensive infrastructure capabilities it offers.\\n\\n## Highlights\\n\\n- **Empowerment:** Innovate faster by spending less time on infrastructure management.\\n- **Versatility:** Tackle diverse serverless use cases, from APIs and scheduled tasks to web sockets and data pipelines.\\n- **Infra & Code:** Streamline development with code and infrastructure deployment handled together.\\n- **Ease of Use:** Deploy complex applications without deep cloud infrastructure expertise, thanks to approachable YAML configuration.\\n- **Language Agnostic:** Develop in your preferred language – Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, PHP, Scala, or F# – the Framework supports them all.\\n- **Full Lifecycle:** Build, deploy, monitor, update, and troubleshoot serverless applications with ease.\\n- **Scalable Organization:** Structure large projects and teams efficiently with built-in support for stages and project composition.\\n- **Plugin Ecosystem:** Extend and modify the Framework\\'s functionality with a rich plugin ecosystem.\\n- **Vibrant Community:** Get support and connect with a passionate community of Serverless developers.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nGet started with the Serverless Framework on AWS [via this guide](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/).\\n\\nHave questions?

So you can\\'t use variables to generate dynamic logical IDs in the custom resources section for example.\\n\\n## Variable Resolvers\\n\\nVariable Resolvers allow you to reference external data sources in your serverless.yml file.\\nEach Resolver has a Provider parent, which is responsible for fetching the credentials.\\nFor example, the `aws` Provider has a `ssm` Resolver and a `s3` Resolver,\\nwhich can fetch data from AWS SSM Parameter Store and S3, respectively.\\n\\nProviders can also have default variables that can be used in the serverless.yml file,\\nsuch as `accountId` for the `aws` Provider.\\n\\nYou can customize Providers and Resolvers by specifying custom configuration options in the `resolvers` block of the `stages` section.\\nThen, you can reference the customized Resolvers using `${customProviderName:customResolverName:key}` syntax.\\n\\n**You can always reference the default Resolvers provided by Providers, even if you don’t define them explicitly.**\\nFor example,\\nyou can reference the default `s3` Resolver provided by the `aws` Provider using `${aws:s3:myBucket/myKey}` syntax\\n(it will use the AWS provider which provides the credentials for the deployment),\\nor `${customProviderName:s3:myBucket/myKey}` if you define customized Provider configuration.\\n\\n### Examples\\n\\n#### Default Resolvers\\n\\n```yaml\\nfunctions:\\n  hello:\\n    handler: handler.hello\\n    environment:\\n      ACCOUNT_ID: ${aws:accountId} # built-in variable provided by the AWS provider\\n      SSM_VALUE: ${aws:ssm:/path/to/param} # uses the default resolver configuration and the same AWS provider which is used for the deployment\\n      S3_VALUE: ${aws:s3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the default resolver configuration and the same AWS provider which is used for the deployment\\n```\\n\\n#### Customized Resolvers\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  default:\\n    resolvers:\\n      awsAccount1:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: dev-account1-profile-name\\n      awsAccount2:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: dev-account2-profile-name\\n        euS3: # custom resolver configuration defined for the awsAccount2 provider\\n          type: s3\\n          region: eu-west-1\\n  prod:\\n    resolvers:\\n      awsAccount1:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: prod-account1-profile-name\\n      awsAccount2:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: prod-account2-profile-name\\n        euS3: # custom resolver configuration defined for the awsAccount2 provider\\n          type: s3\\n          region: eu-west-1\\n\\nfunctions:\\n  hello:\\n    handler: handler.hello\\n    environment:\\n      ACCOUNT1_ID: ${awsAccount1:accountId} # built-in variable provided by the AWS provider\\n      SSM_VALUE: ${awsAccount1:ssm:/path/to/param} # uses the default resolver configuration even if it\\'s not explicitly defined in the resolvers block\\n      EU_S3_VALUE: ${awsAccount2:euS3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the customized resolver configuration\\n      S3_VALUE: ${awsAccount2:s3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the default resolver configuration even if a customized one (euS3) is defined for the same provider\\n```\\n\\n## Supported Variable Providers:\\n\\n- [Self-References Properties Defined in `serverless.yml`](./self)\\n- [Serverless Core Variables](./core)\\n- [Environment Variables](./env-vars)\\n- [CLI Options](./cli-options)\\n- [External YAML/JSON Files](./file)\\n- [Dynamic Values from Javascript](./javascript)\\n- [Git](./git)\\n- [AWS](./aws)\\n- [HashiCorp](./hashicorp)\\n\\n## Recursively reference properties\\n\\nYou can also **recursively reference properties** with the variable system. This means you can combine multiple values and variable sources for a lot of flexibility.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```yml\\nprovider:\\n  name: aws\\n  environment:\\n    MY_SECRET: ${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}\\n```\\n\\nIf `sls deploy --stage qa` is run, the stage will be set to `qa`, which is used inside the `${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}` variable and it will resolve the `config.qa.json` file and use the `CREDS` key defined.\\n\\n**How that works:**\\n\\n1. `stage` is set to `qa` from the option supplied to the `sls deploy --stage qa` command. If no option is defined, then `${sls:stage}` will use the value in `provider.stage` or default to `dev` if not set.\\n2. `${sls:stage}` resolves to `qa` and is used in `${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}`\\n3. `${file(./config.qa.json):CREDS}` is found & the `CREDS` value is read\\n4. `MY_SECRET` value is set\\n\\nLikewise, if `sls deploy --stage prod` is run the `config.prod.json` file would be found and used.\\n\\n## Setting Variables using Parameters\\n\\nOccasionally you may want to set a variable directly in the `serverless.yml` that you can use throughout the file. In such a case you can use Parameters to set new variables or use them to set stage-specific variables.\\n\\nHere is an example of setting a domain variable based on the stage:\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  default:\\n    params:\\n      domain: ${sls:stage}.example-dev.com\\n  prod:\\n    params:\\n      domain: example.com\\n\\nprovider:\\n  environment:\\n    APP_DOMAIN: ${param:domain}\\n```\\n\\nRead all about parameters in the [Parameters documentation](../../guides/parameters.md).\\n\\n## Multiple Configuration Files\\n\\nAdding many custom resources to your `serverless.yml` file could bloat the whole file, so you can use the Serverless Variable syntax to split this up.\\n\\n```yml\\nresources:\\n  Resources: ${file(cloudformation-resources.json)}\\n```\\n\\nThe corresponding resources which are defined inside the `cloudformation-resources.json` file will be resolved and loaded into the `Resources` section.\\n\\nIn order to use multiple resource files combined with resources inside the `serverless.yml` you can use an array.\\n\\n```yml\\nresources:\\n  - Resources:\\n      ApiGatewayRestApi:\\n        Type: AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi\\n\\n  - ${file(resources/first-cf-resources.yml)}\\n  - ${file(resources/second-cf-resources.yml)}\\n\\n  - Outputs:\\n      CognitoUserPoolId:\\n      Value:\\n        Ref: CognitoUserPool\\n```\\n\\nEach of your cloudformation files has to start with a `Resources` entity\\n\\n```yml\\nResources:\\n  Type: \\'AWS::S3::Bucket\\'\\n  Properties:\\n    BucketName: some-bucket-name\\n```\\n\\n## Default values\\n\\nThe Serverless framework gives you an intuitive way to reference multiple variables as a fallback strategy in case one of the variables is missing. This way you\\'ll be able to use a default value from a certain source, if the variable from another source is missing.\\n\\nFor example, you can use the `opt` variable to get the `memory` CLI option when running `serverless deploy --memory 2048`. If the `memory` option is not provided, the default value of `1024` will be used.\\n\\n```yml\\nfunctions:\\n  hello:\\n    handler: handler.hello\\n    memorySize: ${opt:memory, 1024}\\n```\\n\\nThe default value can also reference another variable.\\n\\n## Read String Variable Values as Boolean Values\\n\\nIn some cases, a parameter expect a `true` or `false` boolean value. If you are using a variable to define the value, it may return as a string (e.g. when using SSM variables) and thus return a `\"true\"` or `\"false\"` string value.\\n\\nTo ensure a boolean value is returned, read the string variable value as a boolean value.

Learn more about [creating a custom plugin](./creating-plugins.md).\\n\\nExplore existing plugins in the [Serverless Framework Plugins repository](https://www.serverless.com/plugins).\\n\\n## Installing plugins\\n\\nPlugins are installed per service. They are not applied globally.\\n\\nTo install a plugin, run the following command in a service directory:\\n\\n```\\nserverless plugin install -n custom-serverless-plugin\\n```\\n\\nThis command will install the plugin via NPM and register it in `serverless.yml`.\\n\\nYou can also install the plugin manually via NPM:\\n\\n```\\nnpm install --save-dev custom-serverless-plugin\\n```\\n\\nand then register it in `serverless.yml` in the `plugins` section:\\n\\n```yml\\n# serverless.yml file\\n\\nplugins:\\n  - custom-serverless-plugin\\n```\\n\\nSome plugins require extra configuration. The `custom` section in `serverless.yml` is where you can add extra configuration for plugins (the plugin\\'s documentation will tell you if you need to add anything there):\\n\\n```yml\\nplugins:\\n  - custom-serverless-plugin\\n\\ncustom:\\n  customkey: customvalue\\n```\\n\\nNote for plugin authors: read [Extending the configuration](./custom-configuration.md) to learn how to enhance `serverless.yml` with configuration validation.\\n\\n## Service local plugin\\n\\nIf you are working on a plugin, or have a plugin that is just designed for one project, it can be loaded from local files:\\n\\n```yml\\nplugins:\\n  - ./local-directory/custom-serverless-plugin\\n```\\n\\nThe path must start with `./` and is relative to the root of your service.\\n\\n## Load Order\\n\\nKeep in mind that the order you define your plugins matters. Serverless loads all the core plugins, and then the custom plugins in the order you\\'ve defined them.\\n\\n```yml\\n# serverless.yml\\n\\nplugins:\\n  - plugin1\\n  - plugin2\\n```\\n\\nIn this case `plugin1` is loaded before `plugin2`.\\n\\n\\nResult 16:\\nFileNode: {\\'basename\\': \\'README.md\\', \\'relative_path\\': \\'docs/guides/observability/README.md\\', \\'node_id\\': 34431}\\npreview: <!--\\ntitle: Serverless Framework - Observability\\ndescription: How to configure observability for your Serverless Framework services\\nshort_title: Observability\\nkeywords: [\\'Serverless Framework\\', \\'Observability\\', \\'Monitoring\\']\\n-->\\n\\n<!-- DOCS-SITE-LINK:START automatically generated  -->\\n\\n### [Read this on the main serverless docs site](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/observability)\\n\\n<!-- DOCS-SITE-LINK:END -->\\n\\n# Observability\\n\\nObservability is a crucial aspect of managing and maintaining your serverless applications. It provides insights into the behavior, performance, and health of your services. The Serverless Framework allows you to automatically configure observability for your services.\\n\\n## Enabling Observability\\n\\nThe Serverless Framework supports multiple observability providers. You can configure it to work with your preferred provider using the `observability` property within the `stages` block in your `serverless.yml` file.\\nBelow is an example of how to enable the Serverless Dashboard observability feature for the `prod` stage:\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  prod:\\n    observability: dashboard\\n```\\n\\n## Configuring Observability\\n\\nFor more granular control, you can specify the observability key as an object and include additional properties. In this configuration, the `provider` key is required, and you must specify the desired provider.\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  prod:\\n    observability:\\n      provider: dashboard\\n      # additional configuration options for the chosen provider\\n      exampleSetting: customValue\\n```\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nLearn more about configuring and using our supported observability providers:\\n\\n- [Serverless Dashboard](./dashboard)\\n- [Axiom](./axiom)\\n\\n\\nResult 17:\\nFileNode: {\\'basename\\': \\'README.md\\', \\'relative_path\\': \\'docs/guides/dashboard/README.md\\', \\'node_id\\': 34439}\\npreview: <!--\\ntitle: Serverless Framework Dashboard - Setup & Overview\\ndescription: An overview and set-up guide for Serverless Framework Dashboard\\nshort_title: Serverless Dashboard - Setup & Overview\\nkeywords: [\\'Serverless Framework\\', \\'Dashboard\\', \\'Setup\\', \\'Overview\\']\\n-->\\n\\n<!-- DOCS-SITE-LINK:START automatically generated  -->\\n\\n### [Read this on the main serverless docs site](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/dashboard/)\\n\\n<!-- DOCS-SITE-LINK:END -->\\n\\n# Serverless Framework Dashboard\\n\\nThe [Serverless Framework Dashboard](https://app.serverless.com/) is a SaaS solution that augments the Serverless Framework CLI to provide a powerful, unified experience to develop, deploy, test, secure and monitor your serverless applications, across all AWS accounts.\\n\\nThe aim of the Serverless Framework and its Dashboard is to offer a seamless, integrated development experience for you and your team throughout the entire lifecycle of your serverless applications.

Review them all below. In 2025, we have begun releasing bigger projects, like the [Serverless Container Framework](https://github.com/serverless/containers), and the [Serverless MCP](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/mcp). As always, we are more excited about the serverless future than ever.\\n\\n## New Features In V.4\\n\\nHere\\'s a list of everything that\\'s new in V.4, so far:\\n\\n- **Improved Custom Domain Support:** You no longer need an external plugin to automatically configure custom domains and SSL certificates for your APIs and more. It\\'s now built into the [Serverless Framework CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/domains).\\n- **Integration with Doppler:** You can now easily fetch Secrets from Doppler via [Serverless Framework Variables](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/doppler).\\n- **Introducing [Serverless MCP](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/mcp):** Built for Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI-powered IDEs, it auto-detects cloud resources from your code, fetching logs, state, and config from AWS, enabling you to debug serverless apps directly in your IDE — no AWS console visit needed! Supports Serverless Framework, Cloudformation, and more.\\n- **Introducing the [Serverless Container Framework](https://github.com/serverless/containers):** One solution to deploy serverless workloads everywhere - This is a new YAML file that works with the Serverless Framework CLI that gives you one experience to easily deploy containers to AWS Lambda and AWS ECS Fargate and migrate between them w/ zero-downtime — all without re-architecting. We launched this as a way to reduce large Lambda bills and give folks flexibility, but it is rapidly become the greatest developer experience for containers on AWS. Support for Google Cloud Run, Azure and more are coming soon.\\n- **Support for AWS SAM, AWS Cloudformation, & Traditional Serverless Framework Projects:** Now, you can use one tool to deploy all three of these IaC project files. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/sam)\\n- **Native Typescript Support:** You can now use `.ts` handlers in your AWS Lambda functions in `serverless.yml` and have them build automatically upon deploy. [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) is now included in the Framework which makes this possible. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/building).\\n- **The AWS AI Stack:** V.4 is optimized for [the AWS AI Stack](https://github.com/serverless/aws-ai-stack). Deploy a full-stack, serverless, boilerplate for AI applications on AWS, featuring Bedrock LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama3.1 and much more.\\n- **New Dev Mode:** Run `serverless dev` to have events from your live architecture routed to your local code, enabling you to make fast changes without deployment. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/dev).\\n- - **Node.js V22:** Support for Node.js version 22 on AWS Lambda.\\n- **New Stages Property:** Easily organize stage-specific config via `stages` and set `default` config to fallback to.\\n- **Improved Compose Experience:** Serverless Compose now has a beautiful new CLI experience that better demonstrates what is being deployed.\\n- **New Terraform & Vault Integrations:** Pull state outputs from several Terraform state storage solutions, and secrets from Vault. [Terraform Docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/terraform) [Vault Docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/vault)\\n- **Support Command:** Send support requests to our team [directly from the CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/support), which auto-include contextual info which you can review before sending.\\n- **Debug Summary for AI:** When you run into a bug, you can run \"serverless support --ai\" to generate a concise report detailing your last bug with all necessary context, optimized for pasting into AI tools such as ChatGPT.\\n- **New AWS Lambda Runtimes:** \"python3.12\", \"dotnet8\", and \"java21\".\\n- **Advanced Logging Controls for AWS Lambda:** Capture Logs in JSON, increased log granularity, and setting a custom Log Group. Here is the [AWS article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-advanced-logging-controls-for-aws-lambda-functions/). Here is the [YAML implementation](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/v4.0/docs/providers/aws/guide/serverless.yml.md#logs)\\n- **Axiom Integration:** Integrate with [Axiom\\'s observability solution](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/observability/axiom) for a powerful logging, metrics and traces experience, at 3X less than AWS cloudwatch.\\n- **AWS SSO:** Environment variables, especially ones set by AWS SSO, are prioritized. The Framework and Dashboard no longer interfere with these.\\n- **Automatic Updates:** These happen by default now. Though, you will be able to control the level of updates you\\'re open to.\\n- **Improved Onboarding & Set-Up:** The `serverless` command has been re-written to be more helpful when setting up a new or existing project.\\n- **Updated Custom Resource Handlers:** All custom resource handlers now use `nodejs20.x`.\\n- **Deprecation Of Non-AWS Providers:** Deprecation of other cloud providers, in favor of handling this better in our upcoming Serverless Framework \"Extensions\".\\n\\n## Breaking Changes\\n\\nWe\\'re seeking to avoid breaking changes for the \"aws\" Provider. However, there are a few large things that are changing to be aware of:\\n\\n- The V.4 License is changing. See the section below for more information on this.\\n- Authentication is required within the CLI.\\n- Non-AWS Providers have been deprecated. We will be introducing new ways in V.4 to use other cloud infrastructure vendors.\\n\\nIf you stumble upon additional breaking changes, please create an issue. To learn more about what\\'s different and potential breaking changes, please see our [Upgrading to Serverless Framework V4 Documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/upgrading-v4).\\n\\n## License Changes in V.4\\n\\nPlease note, the structure and licensing of the V.4 repository differ from the V.4 npm module. The npm module contains some proprietary licensed software, as V.4 transitions to a common SaaS product, [as previously announced](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-framework-v4-a-new-model). The original Serverless Framework source code and more will continue to remain MIT license software, the repository will soon be restructured to clearly distinguish between proprietary and open-source components.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n# Contents\\n\\n- [Features](#features)\\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\\n- [Examples](https://github.com/serverless/examples)\\n- [Plugins](https://github.com/serverless/plugins)\\n- [Community](#community)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n# <a name=\"features\"></a>Features'}, {'FileNode': {'basename': 'README.md', 'relative_path': 'test/README.md', 'node_id': 15}, 'preview': \"# How to run, organize and write tests?\\n\\nAs framework deals with significant technical debt baggage many of currently configured tests do not\\nresemble practise we want to follow in newly introduced tests.\\n\\nPlease follow this document as the only guideline, it also provides links to tests that serve as a good example to replicate\\n\\n## Unit tests\\n\\nTests are configured with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test framework, and can be run with following command\\n\\n```\\nnpm test\\n```\\n\\nAll new tests should be configured with help of [runServerless](./utils/run-serverless.js) util - it's the only way to test functionality against completely intialized `serverless` instance, and it's the only scenario that reflects real world usage.\\n\\nCheck documentation of `runServerless` at [@serverless/test/docs/run-serverless](https://github.com/serverless/test/blob/main/docs/run-serverless.md#run-serverless). Note that `runServerless` as configured at `./utils/run-serverless.js` supports two additional options (`fixture` and `configExt`), which provides out of a box setup to run _Serverless_ instance against prepared fixture with eventually extended service configuration\\n\\nAs `runServerless` tests are expensive, it's good to ensure a _minimal_ count of `runServerless` runs to test given scope of problems. Ideally with one service example we should cover most of the test cases we can (good example of such approach is [ALB health check tests](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/80e70e7affd54418361c4d54bdef1561af6b8826/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/alb/lib/healthCheck.test.js#L18-L127))\\n\\nWhen creating a new test, it is an established practice to name the top-level describe after the path to the file, as shown in [AWS Kafka tests](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/b36cdf2db6ee25f7defe6f2c02dd40e1d5cb65c4/test/unit/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/kafka.test.js#L10).\\n\\n### Existing test examples:\\n\\n- [Run against config passed inline](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/73107822945a878abbdebe2309e8e9d87cc2858a/lib/plugins/aws/package/lib/generateCoreTemplate.test.js#L11-L14)\\n- [Run against preprepared fixture](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/74634c3317a116077a008375e20d6a5b99b1256e/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/functions/index.test.js#L2605-L2608)\\n  - Fixtures can be [extended](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/74634c3317a116077a008375e20d6a5b99b1256e/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/httpApi/index.test.js#L95-L99) on spot. Whenever possible it's better to extend existing fixture (e.g. basic `function`) instead of creating new one (check [ALB health check tests](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/80e70e7affd54418361c4d54bdef1561af6b8826/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/alb/lib/healthCheck.test.js) for good example on such approach)\\n  - If needed introduce new test fixtures at [test/fixtures](./fixtures)\\n\\nExample of test files fully backed by `runServerless`:\\n\\n- [lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/httpApi.js](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/main/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/httpApi.js)\\n\\nIf we're about to add new tests to an existing test file with tests written old way, then best is to create another `describe` block for new tests at the bottom (as it's done [here](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/main/test/unit/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/functions.test.js#L1049))\\n\\n_Note: PR's which rewrite existing tests into new method are very welcome! (but, ideally each PR should cover single test file rewrite)_\\n\\n### Coverage\\n\\nWe aim for a (near) 100% test coverage, so make sure your tests cover as much of your code as possible.\\n\\nDuring development, you can easily check coverage by running `npm run coverage`, then opening the `index.html` file inside the `coverage` directory.\\n\\n## AWS Integration tests\\n\\nRun all tests via:\\n\\n```\\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx npm run integration-test-run-all\\n```\\n\\n_Note: Home folder is mocked for test run, therefore relying on `AWS_PROFILE` won't work. _ and _secret key_, need to be configured directly into env variables\\\\_\\n\\n_Note: Some integration tests depend on shared infrastructure stack (see below)_\\n\\nIdeally any feature that integrates with AWS functionality should be backed by integration test.\\n\\nCheck existing set of AWS integration tests at [test/integration](./integration)\\n\\n### Running specific integration test\\n\\nPass test file to Mocha directly as follows\\n\\n```\\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx npx mocha test/integration/{chosen}.test.js\\n```\\n\\n### Tests that depend on shared infrastructure stack\\n\\nDue to the fact that some of the tests require a bit more complex infrastructure setup which might be lengthy, two additional commands has been made available:\\n\\n- `integration-test-setup` - used for setting up all needed intrastructure dependencies\\n- `integration-test-teardown` - used for tearing down the infrastructure setup by the above command\\n\\nSuch tests take advantage of `isDependencyStackAvailable` util to check if all needed dependencies are ready.

With features like auto-scaling and no cost when idle, AWS Lambda offers a compute experience that demands so little maintenance it feels _\"serverless\"_.\\n\\nMonths later, the Serverless Framework was created to streamline the deployment of various use-cases on AWS Lambda. The Serverless Framework introduced the concept of _\"serverless architectures\"_, a transformative approach to building applications on the cloud, integrating AWS Lambda and cloud infrastructure with similar \"serverless\" qualities, to enable developers to create entire applications that scale massively with minimal maintenance.\\n\\nToday, the Serverless Framework continues to be the original, leading and most trusted tool for enterprises and start-ups building serverless architectures. Renowned Fortune 500 companies such as the _New York Times_, _Nike_, and _EA Games_ utilize it, while numerous startups have reached unicorn valuations and achieved notable exits using the Framework. These successes have been accomplished with relatively small engineering teams, leveraging the power of serverless architectures.\\n\\nThe mission of the Serverless Framework is to empower all developers to build more and manage less.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe Serverless Framework consists of a Command Line Interface and an optional Dashboard, and helps you deploy code and infrastructure together on Amazon Web Services, while increasingly supporting other cloud providers. The Framework is a YAML-based experience that uses simplified syntax to help you deploy complex infrastructure patterns easily, without needing to be a cloud expert. It is developed and maintained by Serverless Inc., a specialized software company based in San Francisco, California. Initially launched as an open-source project, the Framework has since transitioned to a SaaS product to better support its scalability and the extensive infrastructure capabilities it offers.\\n\\n## Highlights\\n\\n- **Empowerment:** Innovate faster by spending less time on infrastructure management.\\n- **Versatility:** Tackle diverse serverless use cases, from APIs and scheduled tasks to web sockets and data pipelines.\\n- **Infra & Code:** Streamline development with code and infrastructure deployment handled together.\\n- **Ease of Use:** Deploy complex applications without deep cloud infrastructure expertise, thanks to approachable YAML configuration.\\n- **Language Agnostic:** Develop in your preferred language – Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, PHP, Scala, or F# – the Framework supports them all.\\n- **Full Lifecycle:** Build, deploy, monitor, update, and troubleshoot serverless applications with ease.\\n- **Scalable Organization:** Structure large projects and teams efficiently with built-in support for stages and project composition.\\n- **Plugin Ecosystem:** Extend and modify the Framework\\'s functionality with a rich plugin ecosystem.\\n- **Vibrant Community:** Get support and connect with a passionate community of Serverless developers.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nGet started with the Serverless Framework on AWS [via this guide](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/).\\n\\nHave questions?

So you can\\'t use variables to generate dynamic logical IDs in the custom resources section for example.\\n\\n## Variable Resolvers\\n\\nVariable Resolvers allow you to reference external data sources in your serverless.yml file.\\nEach Resolver has a Provider parent, which is responsible for fetching the credentials.\\nFor example, the `aws` Provider has a `ssm` Resolver and a `s3` Resolver,\\nwhich can fetch data from AWS SSM Parameter Store and S3, respectively.\\n\\nProviders can also have default variables that can be used in the serverless.yml file,\\nsuch as `accountId` for the `aws` Provider.\\n\\nYou can customize Providers and Resolvers by specifying custom configuration options in the `resolvers` block of the `stages` section.\\nThen, you can reference the customized Resolvers using `${customProviderName:customResolverName:key}` syntax.\\n\\n**You can always reference the default Resolvers provided by Providers, even if you don’t define them explicitly.**\\nFor example,\\nyou can reference the default `s3` Resolver provided by the `aws` Provider using `${aws:s3:myBucket/myKey}` syntax\\n(it will use the AWS provider which provides the credentials for the deployment),\\nor `${customProviderName:s3:myBucket/myKey}` if you define customized Provider configuration.\\n\\n### Examples\\n\\n#### Default Resolvers\\n\\n```yaml\\nfunctions:\\n  hello:\\n    handler: handler.hello\\n    environment:\\n      ACCOUNT_ID: ${aws:accountId} # built-in variable provided by the AWS provider\\n      SSM_VALUE: ${aws:ssm:/path/to/param} # uses the default resolver configuration and the same AWS provider which is used for the deployment\\n      S3_VALUE: ${aws:s3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the default resolver configuration and the same AWS provider which is used for the deployment\\n```\\n\\n#### Customized Resolvers\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  default:\\n    resolvers:\\n      awsAccount1:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: dev-account1-profile-name\\n      awsAccount2:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: dev-account2-profile-name\\n        euS3: # custom resolver configuration defined for the awsAccount2 provider\\n          type: s3\\n          region: eu-west-1\\n  prod:\\n    resolvers:\\n      awsAccount1:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: prod-account1-profile-name\\n      awsAccount2:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: prod-account2-profile-name\\n        euS3: # custom resolver configuration defined for the awsAccount2 provider\\n          type: s3\\n          region: eu-west-1\\n\\nfunctions:\\n  hello:\\n    handler: handler.hello\\n    environment:\\n      ACCOUNT1_ID: ${awsAccount1:accountId} # built-in variable provided by the AWS provider\\n      SSM_VALUE: ${awsAccount1:ssm:/path/to/param} # uses the default resolver configuration even if it\\'s not explicitly defined in the resolvers block\\n      EU_S3_VALUE: ${awsAccount2:euS3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the customized resolver configuration\\n      S3_VALUE: ${awsAccount2:s3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the default resolver configuration even if a customized one (euS3) is defined for the same provider\\n```\\n\\n## Supported Variable Providers:\\n\\n- [Self-References Properties Defined in `serverless.yml`](./self)\\n- [Serverless Core Variables](./core)\\n- [Environment Variables](./env-vars)\\n- [CLI Options](./cli-options)\\n- [External YAML/JSON Files](./file)\\n- [Dynamic Values from Javascript](./javascript)\\n- [Git](./git)\\n- [AWS](./aws)\\n- [HashiCorp](./hashicorp)\\n\\n## Recursively reference properties\\n\\nYou can also **recursively reference properties** with the variable system. This means you can combine multiple values and variable sources for a lot of flexibility.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```yml\\nprovider:\\n  name: aws\\n  environment:\\n    MY_SECRET: ${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}\\n```\\n\\nIf `sls deploy --stage qa` is run, the stage will be set to `qa`, which is used inside the `${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}` variable and it will resolve the `config.qa.json` file and use the `CREDS` key defined.\\n\\n**How that works:**\\n\\n1. `stage` is set to `qa` from the option supplied to the `sls deploy --stage qa` command. If no option is defined, then `${sls:stage}` will use the value in `provider.stage` or default to `dev` if not set.\\n2. `${sls:stage}` resolves to `qa` and is used in `${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}`\\n3. `${file(./config.qa.json):CREDS}` is found & the `CREDS` value is read\\n4. `MY_SECRET` value is set\\n\\nLikewise, if `sls deploy --stage prod` is run the `config.prod.json` file would be found and used.\\n\\n## Setting Variables using Parameters\\n\\nOccasionally you may want to set a variable directly in the `serverless.yml` that you can use throughout the file. In such a case you can use Parameters to set new variables or use them to set stage-specific variables.\\n\\nHere is an example of setting a domain variable based on the stage:\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  default:\\n    params:\\n      domain: ${sls:stage}.example-dev.com\\n  prod:\\n    params:\\n      domain: example.com\\n\\nprovider:\\n  environment:\\n    APP_DOMAIN: ${param:domain}\\n```\\n\\nRead all about parameters in the [Parameters documentation](../../guides/parameters.md).\\n\\n## Multiple Configuration Files\\n\\nAdding many custom resources to your `serverless.yml` file could bloat the whole file, so you can use the Serverless Variable syntax to split this up.\\n\\n```yml\\nresources:\\n  Resources: ${file(cloudformation-resources.json)}\\n```\\n\\nThe corresponding resources which are defined inside the `cloudformation-resources.json` file will be resolved and loaded into the `Resources` section.\\n\\nIn order to use multiple resource files combined with resources inside the `serverless.yml` you can use an array.\\n\\n```yml\\nresources:\\n  - Resources:\\n      ApiGatewayRestApi:\\n        Type: AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi\\n\\n  - ${file(resources/first-cf-resources.yml)}\\n  - ${file(resources/second-cf-resources.yml)}\\n\\n  - Outputs:\\n      CognitoUserPoolId:\\n      Value:\\n        Ref: CognitoUserPool\\n```\\n\\nEach of your cloudformation files has to start with a `Resources` entity\\n\\n```yml\\nResources:\\n  Type: \\'AWS::S3::Bucket\\'\\n  Properties:\\n    BucketName: some-bucket-name\\n```\\n\\n## Default values\\n\\nThe Serverless framework gives you an intuitive way to reference multiple variables as a fallback strategy in case one of the variables is missing. This way you\\'ll be able to use a default value from a certain source, if the variable from another source is missing.\\n\\nFor example, you can use the `opt` variable to get the `memory` CLI option when running `serverless deploy --memory 2048`. If the `memory` option is not provided, the default value of `1024` will be used.\\n\\n```yml\\nfunctions:\\n  hello:\\n    handler: handler.hello\\n    memorySize: ${opt:memory, 1024}\\n```\\n\\nThe default value can also reference another variable.\\n\\n## Read String Variable Values as Boolean Values\\n\\nIn some cases, a parameter expect a `true` or `false` boolean value. If you are using a variable to define the value, it may return as a string (e.g. when using SSM variables) and thus return a `\"true\"` or `\"false\"` string value.\\n\\nTo ensure a boolean value is returned, read the string variable value as a boolean value. For example:\\n\\n```yml\\nprovider:\\n  tracing:\\n    apiGateway: ${strToBool(${ssm:API_GW_DEBUG_ENABLED})}\\n```\\n\\nThese are examples that explain how the conversion works after first lowercasing the passed string value:\\n\\n```plaintext\\n${strToBool(true)} => true\\n${strToBool(false)} => false\\n${strToBool(True)} => true\\n${strToBool(False)} => false\\n${strToBool(TRUE)} => true\\n${strToBool(FALSE)} => false\\n${strToBool(0)} => false\\n${strToBool(1)} => true\\n${strToBool(2)} => Error\\n${strToBool(null)} => Error\\n${strToBool(anything)} => Error\\n```'}, {'FileNode': {'basename': 'README.md', 'relative_path': 'docs/guides/variables/hashicorp/README.md', 'node_id': 34393}, 'preview': '<!--\\ntitle: Serverless Framework - Variables - HashiCorp-specific variables\\ndescription: >-\\n  How to reference HashiCorp-specific variables in the Serverless Framework for\\n  efficient configuration and deployment.\\nshort_title: Serverless Variables - HashiCorp Variables\\nkeywords:\\n  - Serverless Framework\\n  - HashiCorp-specific variables\\n  - configuration\\n  - deployment\\n-->\\n\\n# Resolvers\\n\\n- [HashiCorp Terraform State Outputs](terraform)\\n- [HashiCorp Vault Secrets](vault)'}, {'FileNode': {'basename': 'README.md', 'relative_path': 'docs/guides/variables/aws/README.md', 'node_id': 34404}, 'preview': '<!--\\ntitle: Serverless Framework - Variables - AWS-specific variables\\ndescription: >-\\n  How to reference AWS-specific variables in the Serverless Framework for\\n  efficient configuration and deployment.\\nshort_title: Serverless Variables - AWS Variables\\nkeywords:\\n  - Serverless Framework\\n  - AWS-specific variables\\n  - configuration\\n  - deployment\\n  - accountId\\n  - region\\n-->\\n\\n# Resolvers\\n\\n- [AWS S3](s3)\\n- [AWS SSM Parameter Store & Secrets Manager](ssm)\\n- [AWS CloudFormation Outputs](cf-stack)\\n\\n# Configuration options\\n\\n| Option            | Required |  Type   |  Default  | Description                                                          |\\n| ----------------- | :------: | :-----: | :-------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| `accessKeyId`     |    No    | String  |           | AWS Access Key ID                                                    |\\n| `secretAccessKey` |    No    | String  |           | AWS Secret Access Key                                                |\\n| `sessionToken`    |    No    | String  |           | AWS Session Token                                                    |\\n| `region`          |    No    | String  | us-east-1 | AWS region                                                           |\\n| `profile`         |    No    | String  |           | AWS profile name                                                     |\\n| `dashboard`       |    No    | Boolean |   true    | Whether Serverless Dashboard AWS Provider credentials should be used |\\n\\n## Example\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  default:\\n    resolvers:\\n      aws-account-1:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: account1-profile-name\\n        region: us-west-2\\n        accessKeyId: ${env:ACCOUNT1_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}\\n        secretAccessKey: ${env:ACCOUNT1_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}\\n        dashboard: false\\n```\\n\\n# Provider-specific variables\\n\\nYou can reference AWS-specific values as the source of your variables.

We hope it\\'s a breath of fresh air compared to the complexity of interacting with the AWS Console across several accounts, directly.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n- **Deployments:** Easily see all Serverless Framework deployments made by you and your team, via CI/CD or local installations of the CLI, across all of your AWS accounts, in one place. Quickly check who made the deployment, what the status is, how it may have failed, see git metadata, serverless.yml, outputs, and much more.\\n\\n- **Secrets:** Set and share secrets in one place, for use within your Serverless Framework `serverless.yml` files. This works across all AWS accounts, so it\\'s ideal for making secrets easy to use without wrestling with AWS permissions to access them. Secrets are encrypted and secure by default.\\n\\n- **Observability:** The richest and slickest observability solution for AWS Lambda on the market. We\\'ve spent years crafting an observability solution that developers love, specializing in AWS Lambda. Set-up requires zero effort and you will instantly get rich Metrics, Traces, Logs and Alerts, just deploy with the Serverless Framework. The Observability features also support non-Serverless Framework deployed AWS Lambda functions. Simply connect your AWS accounts and you\\'ll be able to instrument all of the AWS Lambda functions in them.\\n\\n- **Providers:** Providers make it easy to manage deployment access to your AWS accounts. Each Provider connects to 1 AWS account, and you can assign it to specific Services, Stages, or set a Provider as a default across an entire AWS account. This enables your team to never have to deal with local AWS credentials. Providers use an AWS IAM Role to connect to your account and provide short-term credentials for every deployment, which is more secure by default.\\n\\n- **CI/CD:** CI/CD optimized for Serverless Framework that works out-of-the-box. Simply connect it to Github or BitBucket to enable automated deployments. Set up preview deployments for branches, and much more.\\n\\n## Minimum Version Requirements\\n\\nTo use Serverless Framework Dashboard, you must be using Serverless Framework CLI version 1.48.0 or later.\\n\\nFor Serverless Framework\\'s new Observability offering, you must use version 3.35.0 or later.\\n\\n## Set-Up\\n\\nIf you don\\'t already have a Serverless Framework account, create a new account at [https://app.serverless.com](https://app.serverless.com).\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have existing Serverless Framework Services, follow the [Getting Started with the Serverless Framework and AWS](../../getting-started.md) guide. This will help you get a Serverless Framework Service deployed to AWS, and enabled with the Dashboard.\\n\\nIf you have existing Serverless Framework Services, in the directory with your Service\\'s `serverless.yml` file, run the `serverless` command. This will walk you through the setup process, including setting up your AWS account credentials and creating an organization and application from the Dashboard. Once completed, you\\'ll notice that the `org` and `app` fields will be added to your `serverless.yml` to indicate the org/app to which this service belongs.\\n\\nYou can also add the configuration manually to your `serverless.yml` files within your Serverless Framework Services to connect to the Dashboard.\\n\\n```YAML\\n\\norg: # Your Serverless Framework Org name (e.g. acme-inc)\\napp: # A parent namespce for this Service and related Services App name (e.g. mobile-app), to improve Serverless Framework Dashboard organization\\n\\n```\\n\\nYou must deploy your Service with the above configuration in your YAML file to have it show in the Dashboard. Run serverless deploy to do this.\\n\\nIf you want to enable Observability (metrics, traces, logs) for your AWS Lambda functions within Serverless Framework Dashboard, you will have to add the following in the stages block of your serverless.yml:\\n\\n```yml\\nstages:\\n  prod:\\n    observability: true # turn on observability in the \"prod\" Stage.\\n  dev:\\n    observability: true # turn on observability in the \"dev\" Stage.\\n  default:\\n    observability: false # turn off observability for all other Stages.\\n```\\n\\nTo set up Observability, Serverless Framework will automatically create an AWS IAM Role within the AWS account you deployed to, giving Serverless Inc permission to AWS Cloudwatch and more. [You can transparently see the permissions this role requires in Github](https://github.com/serverless/console/blob/main/instrumentation/aws/iam-role-cfn-template.yaml)'}, {'FileNode': {'basename': 'README.md', 'relative_path': 'docs/guides/dashboard/monitoring/README.md', 'node_id': 34448}, 'preview': '<!--\\ntitle: Serverless Framework - Monitoring & Observability - Overview & Setup\\ndescription: An overview and setup guide for Serverless Framework\\'s Monitoring & Observability features, including metrics, traces, logs, and more.\\nshort_title: Serverless Dashboard Observability - Overview & Setup\\nkeywords:\\n  [\\n    \\'Serverless Framework\\',\\n    \\'Monitoring\\',\\n    \\'Observability\\',\\n    \\'Setup\\',\\n    \\'Metrics\\',\\n    \\'Traces\\',\\n    \\'Logs\\',\\n  ]\\n-->\\n\\n<!-- DOCS-SITE-LINK:START automatically generated  -->\\n\\n### [Read this on the main serverless docs site](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/monitoring/)\\n\\n<!-- DOCS-SITE-LINK:END -->\\n\\n# Monitoring & Observability\\n\\nEasily monitor and observe AWS Lambda functions with Serverless Framework. Access Metrics, Traces, Logs, Errors, and more, across all AWS accounts and Serverless Framework Services.\\n\\nWorks with or without deploying through Serverless Framework. Just connect your AWS account.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n- A global view of Metrics, Traces, Logs, and Errors across all AWS accounts.\\n- Easily search through data via powerful filters.\\n- Instant error alerts.\\n- Auto-sample trace data to save costs.\\n- Detect code-defined API routes, like in Express.js.\\n- No set-up or complex instrumentation required.\\n\\n## Set-Up\\n\\nCurrently Serverless Framework Monitoring & Observability supports the Node.js 12+ and Python 3.8+ AWS Lambda runtimes only, and only AWS Commercial Regions (not GovCloud or China Regions).\\n\\nTo enable Serverless Framework Monitoring & Observability, first create a Serverless Framework account [here](https://app.serverless.com).\\n\\nNext, you must connect your AWS account(s) directly to Serverless Framework\\'s platform via an IAM Role. The permissions for this IAM Role are available in the [Dashboard Github Repo](https://github.com/serverless/dashboard), for your review.\\n\\nThere are two ways to connect your AWS account(s), _via Serverless Framework CLI_, and _via Serverless Framework Dashboard UI_.\\n\\nPlease note, enabling Serverless Framework\\'s Monitoring & Observability features will create a few resources on AWS accounts they\\'re connected to, adding minimal costs to your AWS accounts.\\n\\n### Set-Up Via Serverless Framework Dashboard UI\\n\\nThe most convenient way to set up Monitoring & Observability for multiple AWS accounts or accounts with many AWS Lambda functions is to do so via the Serverless Framework Dashboard UI.\\n\\nIn the navigation bar on the left, click on the \"Settings\" icon, and then click on the \"Integrations\" tab. Here is where you connect AWS accounts.\\n\\nIn a separate browser window, log into the AWS Account via the browser that you wish to connect to. You will need to have permission to create IAM Roles with the [required permissions](https://github.com/serverless/dashboard) for Monitoring & Observability.\\n\\nIn the \"Integrations\" view, click the \"Add Integrations\" button. This launches a quick process that opens a new browser window containing AWS Console\\'s AWS CloudFormation Stack Create view. This window is pre-loaded with an AWS CloudFormation Stack Template that contains an AWS IAM Role with all of the permissions Serverless Framework\\'s Monitoring & Observability features need. At the bottom of this page, click \"Create\".\\n\\nWhile the CloudFormation Stack is creating, go back to the Serverless Framework Dashboard. The Integration view should have detected your Stack is being created and this view will continue to update in real-time until the integration is completed. No other steps are required on your behalf.\\n\\nRepeat this step to connect as many AWS accounts that you\\'d like to enable Monitoring & Observability for.\\n\\nOnce an AWS account is connected, you will need to choose the AWS Lambda functions you wish to enable Monitoring & Observability on. You should see a newly created AWS Integration in the \"Integrations\" view. We recommend giving that AWS Account a name (e.g. \"production\", \"development\") so it\\'s easier to remember and find in Dashboard\\'s query filters. On the Integration, click the \"Edit\" button, and you will see all of the AWS Lambda functions within that AWS account.\\n\\nClick the \"Instrument\" toggle on individual AWS Lambda functions, or click the toggle in the table header to enable instrumentation on all of the functions within that page (you\\'ll have to repeat this on each page if you have multiple pages of AWS Lambda functions). Click \"Save\". This will instrument the AWS Lambda functions in the background. You can go through each page and continue to instrument AWS Lambda functions since instrumentation happens asynchronously.\\n\\nGo to the Metrics or Explorer view. Make sure your AWS Lambda functions are being invoked. After a few minutes, you should see data appear.\\n\\nPlease note, Metrics, Traces and more typically can take up to 10 minutes before they are visible in Serverless Framework Dashboard, after an AWS account has been integrated.\\n\\n### Set-Up Via Serverless Framework CLI\\n\\nYou can use the Serverless Framework CLI to enable Monitoring & Observability. This approach will automatically connect the Serverless Framework Platform to an AWS account and enable monitoring on all of the AWS Lambda functions for the selected stages within the Serverless Framework Service.\\n\\nHowever, if you want to connect multiple AWS accounts and/or enable monitoring on all AWS Lambda functions within an AWS account, setting it up via the Serverless Framework Dashboard UI is more convenient, as you can accomplish this in a few clicks.\\n\\nWithin the working directory of a Serverless Framework Service, ensure the Service is first connected to the Serverless Framework Dashboard. This can be confirmed by the presence of an org and app properties within the serverless.yml file. If the Service is not connected to the Dashboard, run the `serverless` command within the working directory of the Serverless Framework Service. Once your service is connected to the Serverless Dashboard, you can control your observability instrumentation settings under the stages property in your serverless.yml file:\\n\\n```yml\\n# Ensure these properties are present to connect to the Dashboard\\norg: my-org\\napp: my-app\\n\\n# Control observability instrumentation settings under stages\\nstages:\\n  dev:\\n    observability: true # Turn on observability in the dev stage\\n  prod:\\n    observability: true # Turn on observability in the prod stage\\n  default:\\n    observability: false # Turn off observability in all other stages\\n```\\n\\nNow, whenever you deploy, observability will be enabled or disabled according to the stage you are deploying to. In the above example, observability will be enabled in the dev and prod stages but disabled in all other stages.\\n\\nAfter deployment, confirm everything worked within the Serverless Framework Dashboard. Go to \"Settings\" > \"Integrations,\" and you should see the AWS account that was recently integrated. We highly recommend giving that account a name so it\\'s easier to remember and find in the Dashboard\\'s query filters.\\n\\nIf you click on the \"Edit\" button on that Integration, you should see all of the AWS Lambda functions in the account, indicating which ones are enabled and which are disabled.\\n\\nPlease note, Metrics, Traces and more typically can take up to 10 minutes before they are visible in Serverless Framework Dashboard, after an AWS account has been integrated.\\n\\n## Advanced Instrumentation Using The SDK\\n\\nIn addition to the out-of-the-box instrumentation provided by Serverless Framework Dashboard, you can customize instrumentation using the Serverless SDK for richer use cases, such as:\\n\\n- Capturing handled errors so that they are reported elegantly in Serverless Framework Dashboard.\\n- Capturing custom Trace Spans.\\n- Capturing Error and Warnings Events.\\n- Adding Custom Tags to Traces for better searchability.\\n- Integrating with structured logging libraries.\\n\\nSee the SDK documentation for Node and Python for details:\\n\\n- [Full NodeJS Documentation](./sdk/nodejs.md)\\n- [Full Python Documentation](./sdk/python.md)\\n\\n## Supported AWS Lambda Runtimes\\n\\nServerless Framework\\'s Monitoring & Observability features currently support the following AWS Lambda Runtimes:\\n\\n- nodejs14.x\\n- nodejs16.x\\n- nodejs18.x\\n- python3.8\\n- python3.9\\n- python3.10\\n- python3.11\\n\\n## Supported AWS Regions\\n\\nServerless Framework\\'s Monitoring & Observability features currently support all of the Commercial AWS Regions. They do not support GovCloud or reginos in China.\\n\\n## How Integration Works\\n\\nServerless Framework\\'s Monitoring & Observability features use a few approaches to thoroughly collect all Metrics, Traces, Errors and more from your AWS Lambda functions. This is all done via an AWS IAM Role that is created when you integrate your AWS account with Serverless Framework\\'s Platform. The permissions for this AWS IAM Role are kept in [Github here](https://github.com/serverless/dashboard), so that you can easily review what\\'s required. You can remove this IAM Role at any time. But we recommend hitting \"Remove\" on the Integration within the Dashboard because it will automatically un-instrument the AWS account and AWS Lambda functions, in addition to deleting the IAM Role.\\n\\nThe first thing an AWS account integration does is create a Kinesis Firehose within your AWS account connected to a Cloudwatch Logs Subscription to each of your AWS Lambda functions which publish logs into that Firehose. The Serverless Framework Platform ingests log data from that Kinesis Firehose. This helps us collect Logs and more from your AWS Lambda functions. During each invocation, the Serverless Framework logs a compressed payload containing Trace information within your AWS Cloudwatch Logs. This can be identified easily because it starts with `SERVERLESS_TELEMETRY`.'}, {'FileNode': {'basename': 'README.md', 'relative_path': 'docs/guides/dashboard/monitoring/sdk/README.md', 'node_id': 34456}, 'preview': \"<!--\\ntitle: Serverless Framework - Monitoring & Observability - SDKs\\ndescription: Learn how to use the Serverless Framework SDK for monitoring and observability in your serverless applications.\\nshort_title: Serverless Observability - SDK\\nkeywords:\\n  [\\n    'Serverless Framework',\\n    'SDK',\\n    'Monitoring',\\n    'Observability',\\n    'Lambda',\\n    'Instrumentation',\\n  ]\\n-->\\n\\n<!-- DOCS-SITE-LINK:START automatically generated  -->\\n\\n### [Read this on the main serverless docs site](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/sdk/)\\n\\n<!-- DOCS-SITE-LINK:END -->\\n\\n# Serverless Framework SDK\\n\\nWhen using the Serverless Framework Dashboard, the Framework automatically injects the `serverless_sdk` module into your lambda package and wraps your lambda to automatically instrument all the monitoring features in the Dashboard.\\n\\nIt also has certain features you can use directly in your lambda such as capturing an error in the Dashboard without causing your lambda to error and custom function spans.\\n\\n[NodeJS Documentation](./nodejs.md)\\n\\n[Python Documentation](./python.md)\\n\\n## Advanced Span Configuration\\n\\nFor most of the SDK configuration, like turning on/off span collection, follow the\\n[Monitoring Configuration](../README.md/#configuration) instructions to modify your\\nserverless.yml appropriately.\\n\\nIf needed, you can configure HTTP span collection with the following environment variables\\n\\n- `SERVERLESS_ENTERPRISE_SPANS_CAPTURE_HOSTS` - `*` by default.

Currently Github and BitBucket are supported as a VCS providers. Your project, including the serverless.yml file, must be checked into a repo.\\n2. **Must be deployed on AWS**. The dashboard currently only supports AWS as a cloud service provider. Other cloud service providers are a work in progress.\\n3. **Must use the Node or Python runtime**. Currently only Serverless Framework projects using the Node or Python runtimes are supported. Other runtimes may work but are not officially supported.\\n\\n## Getting Started in 3 steps\\n\\n### Step 1: Link your AWS Account\\n\\nAs is the case with deployments from the Serverless Framework CLI, Serverless CI/CD requires access to your AWS Account in order to deploy your services. To make this process as secure as possible, Serverless CI/CD will generate short-lived credentials to your AWS account on each deployment. This is done by creating an AWS Access Role in your AWS account and associating it with a Provider in the Serverless Framework Dashboard.\\n\\nIf you’ve already set up an AWS Access Role with a Provider, you can skip this step. Otherwise, please go through the instructions on our [Provider documentation page](../dashboard/providers.md) to help set one up.\\n\\n### Step 2: Connect to Github\\n\\n1. Login to [https://app.serverless.com/](https://app.serverless.com/).\\n2. Navigate to the app which contains the service you want to deploy and click the menu icon (...) on the right hand side and choose \"settings\"\\n3. In the “connect to git” section, click “connect to Github” or \"connect to BitBucket\" and follow the instructions to authenticate and install the Serverless Framework app.\\n4. In the “repository settings” section, select the repository and base directory if needed containing your service. The service name specified in the serverless.yml must match the service you are configuring.\\n5. In the \"branch deploys\" section, you can choose to map a specific branch in your repo to the correct stage. When code is merged to that branch it then deploys using that stage and its associated Provider (and parameters).\\n6. Changes will be automatically saved when you make them\\n\\nThat’s it! You do not have to create any configuration files in your repository or define your test commands or your\\ndeployment commands.\\n\\nYour service will now deploy from the master branch and you’ll see all the test results, logs, safeguard pass/fail\\nstatus, and deployment details.\\n\\n### Step 3: Deploy from a Github branch\\n\\nNow that you are setup to deploy all changes to the master branch to the dev stage for your service, go ahead and make a\\ncommit and navigate to “deployments” in the dashboard. You will be able to see the new test and deployment.'}]",

Review them all below. In 2025, we have begun releasing bigger projects, like the [Serverless Container Framework](https://github.com/serverless/containers), and the [Serverless MCP](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/mcp). As always, we are more excited about the serverless future than ever.\\n\\n## New Features In V.4\\n\\nHere\\'s a list of everything that\\'s new in V.4, so far:\\n\\n- **Improved Custom Domain Support:** You no longer need an external plugin to automatically configure custom domains and SSL certificates for your APIs and more. It\\'s now built into the [Serverless Framework CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/domains).\\n- **Integration with Doppler:** You can now easily fetch Secrets from Doppler via [Serverless Framework Variables](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/doppler).\\n- **Introducing [Serverless MCP](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/mcp):** Built for Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI-powered IDEs, it auto-detects cloud resources from your code, fetching logs, state, and config from AWS, enabling you to debug serverless apps directly in your IDE — no AWS console visit needed! Supports Serverless Framework, Cloudformation, and more.\\n- **Introducing the [Serverless Container Framework](https://github.com/serverless/containers):** One solution to deploy serverless workloads everywhere - This is a new YAML file that works with the Serverless Framework CLI that gives you one experience to easily deploy containers to AWS Lambda and AWS ECS Fargate and migrate between them w/ zero-downtime — all without re-architecting. We launched this as a way to reduce large Lambda bills and give folks flexibility, but it is rapidly become the greatest developer experience for containers on AWS. Support for Google Cloud Run, Azure and more are coming soon.\\n- **Support for AWS SAM, AWS Cloudformation, & Traditional Serverless Framework Projects:** Now, you can use one tool to deploy all three of these IaC project files. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/sam)\\n- **Native Typescript Support:** You can now use `.ts` handlers in your AWS Lambda functions in `serverless.yml` and have them build automatically upon deploy. [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) is now included in the Framework which makes this possible. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/building).\\n- **The AWS AI Stack:** V.4 is optimized for [the AWS AI Stack](https://github.com/serverless/aws-ai-stack). Deploy a full-stack, serverless, boilerplate for AI applications on AWS, featuring Bedrock LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama3.1 and much more.\\n- **New Dev Mode:** Run `serverless dev` to have events from your live architecture routed to your local code, enabling you to make fast changes without deployment. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/dev).\\n- - **Node.js V22:** Support for Node.js version 22 on AWS Lambda.\\n- **New Stages Property:** Easily organize stage-specific config via `stages` and set `default` config to fallback to.\\n- **Improved Compose Experience:** Serverless Compose now has a beautiful new CLI experience that better demonstrates what is being deployed.\\n- **New Terraform & Vault Integrations:** Pull state outputs from several Terraform state storage solutions, and secrets from Vault. [Terraform Docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/terraform) [Vault Docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/vault)\\n- **Support Command:** Send support requests to our team [directly from the CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/support), which auto-include contextual info which you can review before sending.\\n- **Debug Summary for AI:** When you run into a bug, you can run \"serverless support --ai\" to generate a concise report detailing your last bug with all necessary context, optimized for pasting into AI tools such as ChatGPT.\\n- **New AWS Lambda Runtimes:** \"python3.12\", \"dotnet8\", and \"java21\".\\n- **Advanced Logging Controls for AWS Lambda:** Capture Logs in JSON, increased log granularity, and setting a custom Log Group.

Though, you will be able to control the level of updates you\\'re open to.\\n- **Improved Onboarding & Set-Up:** The `serverless` command has been re-written to be more helpful when setting up a new or existing project.\\n- **Updated Custom Resource Handlers:** All custom resource handlers now use `nodejs20.x`.\\n- **Deprecation Of Non-AWS Providers:** Deprecation of other cloud providers, in favor of handling this better in our upcoming Serverless Framework \"Extensions\".\\n\\n## Breaking Changes\\n\\nWe\\'re seeking to avoid breaking changes for the \"aws\" Provider. However, there are a few large things that are changing to be aware of:\\n\\n- The V.4 License is changing. See the section below for more information on this.\\n- Authentication is required within the CLI.\\n- Non-AWS Providers have been deprecated. We will be introducing new ways in V.4 to use other cloud infrastructure vendors.\\n\\nIf you stumble upon additional breaking changes, please create an issue. To learn more about what\\'s different and potential breaking changes, please see our [Upgrading to Serverless Framework V4 Documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/upgrading-v4).\\n\\n## License Changes in V.4\\n\\nPlease note, the structure and licensing of the V.4 repository differ from the V.4 npm module. The npm module contains some proprietary licensed software, as V.4 transitions to a common SaaS product, [as previously announced](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-framework-v4-a-new-model). The original Serverless Framework source code and more will continue to remain MIT license software, the repository will soon be restructured to clearly distinguish between proprietary and open-source components.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n# Contents\\n\\n- [Features](#features)\\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\\n- [Examples](https://github.com/serverless/examples)\\n- [Plugins](https://github.com/serverless/plugins)\\n- [Community](#community)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n# <a name=\"features\"></a>Features\\n\\n\\nResult 2:\\nFileNode: {\\'basename\\': \\'README.md\\', \\'relative_path\\': \\'test/README.md\\', \\'node_id\\': 15}\\npreview: # How to run, organize and write tests?\\n\\nAs framework deals with significant technical debt baggage many of currently configured tests do not\\nresemble practise we want to follow in newly introduced tests.\\n\\nPlease follow this document as the only guideline, it also provides links to tests that serve as a good example to replicate\\n\\n## Unit tests\\n\\nTests are configured with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test framework, and can be run with following command\\n\\n```\\nnpm test\\n```\\n\\nAll new tests should be configured with help of [runServerless](./utils/run-serverless.js) util - it\\'s the only way to test functionality against completely intialized `serverless` instance, and it\\'s the only scenario that reflects real world usage.\\n\\nCheck documentation of `runServerless` at [@serverless/test/docs/run-serverless](https://github.com/serverless/test/blob/main/docs/run-serverless.md#run-serverless). Note that `runServerless` as configured at `./utils/run-serverless.js` supports two additional options (`fixture` and `configExt`), which provides out of a box setup to run _Serverless_ instance against prepared fixture with eventually extended service configuration\\n\\nAs `runServerless` tests are expensive, it\\'s good to ensure a _minimal_ count of `runServerless` runs to test given scope of problems. Ideally with one service example we should cover most of the test cases we can (good example of such approach is [ALB health check tests](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/80e70e7affd54418361c4d54bdef1561af6b8826/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/alb/lib/healthCheck.test.js#L18-L127))\\n\\nWhen creating a new test, it is an established practice to name the top-level describe after the path to the file, as shown in [AWS Kafka tests](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/b36cdf2db6ee25f7defe6f2c02dd40e1d5cb65c4/test/unit/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/kafka.test.js#L10).\\n\\n### Existing test examples:\\n\\n- [Run against config passed inline](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/73107822945a878abbdebe2309e8e9d87cc2858a/lib/plugins/aws/package/lib/generateCoreTemplate.test.js#L11-L14)\\n- [Run against preprepared fixture](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/74634c3317a116077a008375e20d6a5b99b1256e/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/functions/index.test.js#L2605-L2608)\\n  - Fixtures can be [extended](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/74634c3317a116077a008375e20d6a5b99b1256e/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/httpApi/index.test.js#L95-L99) on spot. Whenever possible it\\'s better to extend existing fixture (e.g. basic `function`) instead of creating new one (check [ALB health check tests](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/80e70e7affd54418361c4d54bdef1561af6b8826/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/alb/lib/healthCheck.test.js) for good example on such approach)\\n  - If needed introduce new test fixtures at [test/fixtures](./fixtures)\\n\\nExample of test files fully backed by `runServerless`:\\n\\n- [lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/httpApi.js](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/main/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/httpApi.js)\\n\\nIf we\\'re about to add new tests to an existing test file with tests written old way, then best is to create another `describe` block for new tests at the bottom (as it\\'s done [here](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/main/test/unit/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/functions.test.js#L1049))\\n\\n_Note: PR\\'s which rewrite existing tests into new method are very welcome! (but, ideally each PR should cover single test file rewrite)_\\n\\n### Coverage\\n\\nWe aim for a (near) 100% test coverage, so make sure your tests cover as much of your code as possible.\\n\\nDuring development, you can easily check coverage by running `npm run coverage`, then opening the `index.html` file inside the `coverage` directory.\\n\\n## AWS Integration tests\\n\\nRun all tests via:\\n\\n```\\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx npm run integration-test-run-all\\n```\\n\\n_Note: Home folder is mocked for test run, therefore relying on `AWS_PROFILE` won\\'t work. _ and _secret key_, need to be configured directly into env variables\\\\_\\n\\n_Note: Some integration tests depend on shared infrastructure stack (see below)_\\n\\nIdeally any feature that integrates with AWS functionality should be backed by integration test.\\n\\nCheck existing set of AWS integration tests at [test/integration](./integration)\\n\\n### Running specific integration test\\n\\nPass test file to Mocha directly as follows\\n\\n```\\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx npx mocha test/integration/{chosen}.test.js\\n```\\n\\n### Tests that depend on shared infrastructure stack\\n\\nDue to the fact that some of the tests require a bit more complex infrastructure setup which might be lengthy, two additional commands has been made available:\\n\\n- `integration-test-setup` - used for setting up all needed intrastructure dependencies\\n- `integration-test-teardown` - used for tearing down the infrastructure setup by the above command\\n\\nSuch tests take advantage of `isDependencyStackAvailable` util to check if all needed dependencies are ready.

With features like auto-scaling and no cost when idle, AWS Lambda offers a compute experience that demands so little maintenance it feels _\"serverless\"_.\\n\\nMonths later, the Serverless Framework was created to streamline the deployment of various use-cases on AWS Lambda. The Serverless Framework introduced the concept of _\"serverless architectures\"_, a transformative approach to building applications on the cloud, integrating AWS Lambda and cloud infrastructure with similar \"serverless\" qualities, to enable developers to create entire applications that scale massively with minimal maintenance.\\n\\nToday, the Serverless Framework continues to be the original, leading and most trusted tool for enterprises and start-ups building serverless architectures. Renowned Fortune 500 companies such as the _New York Times_, _Nike_, and _EA Games_ utilize it, while numerous startups have reached unicorn valuations and achieved notable exits using the Framework. These successes have been accomplished with relatively small engineering teams, leveraging the power of serverless architectures.\\n\\nThe mission of the Serverless Framework is to empower all developers to build more and manage less.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe Serverless Framework consists of a Command Line Interface and an optional Dashboard, and helps you deploy code and infrastructure together on Amazon Web Services, while increasingly supporting other cloud providers. The Framework is a YAML-based experience that uses simplified syntax to help you deploy complex infrastructure patterns easily, without needing to be a cloud expert. It is developed and maintained by Serverless Inc., a specialized software company based in San Francisco, California. Initially launched as an open-source project, the Framework has since transitioned to a SaaS product to better support its scalability and the extensive infrastructure capabilities it offers.\\n\\n## Highlights\\n\\n- **Empowerment:** Innovate faster by spending less time on infrastructure management.\\n- **Versatility:** Tackle diverse serverless use cases, from APIs and scheduled tasks to web sockets and data pipelines.\\n- **Infra & Code:** Streamline development with code and infrastructure deployment handled together.\\n- **Ease of Use:** Deploy complex applications without deep cloud infrastructure expertise, thanks to approachable YAML configuration.\\n- **Language Agnostic:** Develop in your preferred language – Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, PHP, Scala, or F# – the Framework supports them all.\\n- **Full Lifecycle:** Build, deploy, monitor, update, and troubleshoot serverless applications with ease.\\n- **Scalable Organization:** Structure large projects and teams efficiently with built-in support for stages and project composition.\\n- **Plugin Ecosystem:** Extend and modify the Framework\\'s functionality with a rich plugin ecosystem.\\n- **Vibrant Community:** Get support and connect with a passionate community of Serverless developers.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nGet started with the Serverless Framework on AWS [via this guide](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/).\\n\\nHave questions?

So you can\\'t use variables to generate dynamic logical IDs in the custom resources section for example.\\n\\n## Variable Resolvers\\n\\nVariable Resolvers allow you to reference external data sources in your serverless.yml file.\\nEach Resolver has a Provider parent, which is responsible for fetching the credentials.\\nFor example, the `aws` Provider has a `ssm` Resolver and a `s3` Resolver,\\nwhich can fetch data from AWS SSM Parameter Store and S3, respectively.\\n\\nProviders can also have default variables that can be used in the serverless.yml file,\\nsuch as `accountId` for the `aws` Provider.\\n\\nYou can customize Providers and Resolvers by specifying custom configuration options in the `resolvers` block of the `stages` section.\\nThen, you can reference the customized Resolvers using `${customProviderName:customResolverName:key}` syntax.\\n\\n**You can always reference the default Resolvers provided by Providers, even if you don’t define them explicitly.**\\nFor example,\\nyou can reference the default `s3` Resolver provided by the `aws` Provider using `${aws:s3:myBucket/myKey}` syntax\\n(it will use the AWS provider which provides the credentials for the deployment),\\nor `${customProviderName:s3:myBucket/myKey}` if you define customized Provider configuration.\\n\\n### Examples\\n\\n#### Default Resolvers\\n\\n```yaml\\nfunctions:\\n  hello:\\n    handler: handler.hello\\n    environment:\\n      ACCOUNT_ID: ${aws:accountId} # built-in variable provided by the AWS provider\\n      SSM_VALUE: ${aws:ssm:/path/to/param} # uses the default resolver configuration and the same AWS provider which is used for the deployment\\n      S3_VALUE: ${aws:s3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the default resolver configuration and the same AWS provider which is used for the deployment\\n```\\n\\n#### Customized Resolvers\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  default:\\n    resolvers:\\n      awsAccount1:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: dev-account1-profile-name\\n      awsAccount2:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: dev-account2-profile-name\\n        euS3: # custom resolver configuration defined for the awsAccount2 provider\\n          type: s3\\n          region: eu-west-1\\n  prod:\\n    resolvers:\\n      awsAccount1:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: prod-account1-profile-name\\n      awsAccount2:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: prod-account2-profile-name\\n        euS3: # custom resolver configuration defined for the awsAccount2 provider\\n          type: s3\\n          region: eu-west-1\\n\\nfunctions:\\n  hello:\\n    handler: handler.hello\\n    environment:\\n      ACCOUNT1_ID: ${awsAccount1:accountId} # built-in variable provided by the AWS provider\\n      SSM_VALUE: ${awsAccount1:ssm:/path/to/param} # uses the default resolver configuration even if it\\'s not explicitly defined in the resolvers block\\n      EU_S3_VALUE: ${awsAccount2:euS3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the customized resolver configuration\\n      S3_VALUE: ${awsAccount2:s3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the default resolver configuration even if a customized one (euS3) is defined for the same provider\\n```\\n\\n## Supported Variable Providers:\\n\\n- [Self-References Properties Defined in `serverless.yml`](./self)\\n- [Serverless Core Variables](./core)\\n- [Environment Variables](./env-vars)\\n- [CLI Options](./cli-options)\\n- [External YAML/JSON Files](./file)\\n- [Dynamic Values from Javascript](./javascript)\\n- [Git](./git)\\n- [AWS](./aws)\\n- [HashiCorp](./hashicorp)\\n\\n## Recursively reference properties\\n\\nYou can also **recursively reference properties** with the variable system. This means you can combine multiple values and variable sources for a lot of flexibility.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```yml\\nprovider:\\n  name: aws\\n  environment:\\n    MY_SECRET: ${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}\\n```\\n\\nIf `sls deploy --stage qa` is run, the stage will be set to `qa`, which is used inside the `${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}` variable and it will resolve the `config.qa.json` file and use the `CREDS` key defined.\\n\\n**How that works:**\\n\\n1. `stage` is set to `qa` from the option supplied to the `sls deploy --stage qa` command. If no option is defined, then `${sls:stage}` will use the value in `provider.stage` or default to `dev` if not set.\\n2. `${sls:stage}` resolves to `qa` and is used in `${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}`\\n3. `${file(./config.qa.json):CREDS}` is found & the `CREDS` value is read\\n4. `MY_SECRET` value is set\\n\\nLikewise, if `sls deploy --stage prod` is run the `config.prod.json` file would be found and used.\\n\\n## Setting Variables using Parameters\\n\\nOccasionally you may want to set a variable directly in the `serverless.yml` that you can use throughout the file. In such a case you can use Parameters to set new variables or use them to set stage-specific variables.\\n\\nHere is an example of setting a domain variable based on the stage:\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  default:\\n    params:\\n      domain: ${sls:stage}.example-dev.com\\n  prod:\\n    params:\\n      domain: example.com\\n\\nprovider:\\n  environment:\\n    APP_DOMAIN: ${param:domain}\\n```\\n\\nRead all about parameters in the [Parameters documentation](../../guides/parameters.md).\\n\\n## Multiple Configuration Files\\n\\nAdding many custom resources to your `serverless.yml` file could bloat the whole file, so you can use the Serverless Variable syntax to split this up.\\n\\n```yml\\nresources:\\n  Resources: ${file(cloudformation-resources.json)}\\n```\\n\\nThe corresponding resources which are defined inside the `cloudformation-resources.json` file will be resolved and loaded into the `Resources` section.\\n\\nIn order to use multiple resource files combined with resources inside the `serverless.yml` you can use an array.\\n\\n```yml\\nresources:\\n  - Resources:\\n      ApiGatewayRestApi:\\n        Type: AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi\\n\\n  - ${file(resources/first-cf-resources.yml)}\\n  - ${file(resources/second-cf-resources.yml)}\\n\\n  - Outputs:\\n      CognitoUserPoolId:\\n      Value:\\n        Ref: CognitoUserPool\\n```\\n\\nEach of your cloudformation files has to start with a `Resources` entity\\n\\n```yml\\nResources:\\n  Type: \\'AWS::S3::Bucket\\'\\n  Properties:\\n    BucketName: some-bucket-name\\n```\\n\\n## Default values\\n\\nThe Serverless framework gives you an intuitive way to reference multiple variables as a fallback strategy in case one of the variables is missing. This way you\\'ll be able to use a default value from a certain source, if the variable from another source is missing.\\n\\nFor example, you can use the `opt` variable to get the `memory` CLI option when running `serverless deploy --memory 2048`. If the `memory` option is not provided, the default value of `1024` will be used.\\n\\n```yml\\nfunctions:\\n  hello:\\n    handler: handler.hello\\n    memorySize: ${opt:memory, 1024}\\n```\\n\\nThe default value can also reference another variable.\\n\\n## Read String Variable Values as Boolean Values\\n\\nIn some cases, a parameter expect a `true` or `false` boolean value. If you are using a variable to define the value, it may return as a string (e.g. when using SSM variables) and thus return a `\"true\"` or `\"false\"` string value.\\n\\nTo ensure a boolean value is returned, read the string variable value as a boolean value. For example:\\n\\n```yml\\nprovider:\\n  tracing:\\n    apiGateway: ${strToBool(${ssm:API_GW_DEBUG_ENABLED})}\\n```\\n\\nThese are examples that explain how the conversion works after first lowercasing the passed string value:\\n\\n```plaintext\\n${strToBool(true)} => true\\n${strToBool(false)} => false\\n${strToBool(True)} => true\\n${strToBool(False)} => false\\n${strToBool(TRUE)} => true\\n${strToBool(FALSE)} => false\\n${strToBool(0)} => false\\n${strToBool(1)} => true\\n${strToBool(2)} => Error\\n${strToBool(null)} => Error\\n${strToBool(anything)} => Error\\n```\\n\\n\\nResult 13:\\nFileNode: {\\'basename\\': \\'README.md\\', \\'relative_path\\': \\'docs/guides/variables/hashicorp/README.md\\', \\'node_id\\': 34393}\\npreview: <!--\\ntitle: Serverless Framework - Variables - HashiCorp-specific variables\\ndescription: >-\\n  How to reference HashiCorp-specific variables in the Serverless Framework for\\n  efficient configuration and deployment.\\nshort_title: Serverless Variables - HashiCorp Variables\\nkeywords:\\n  - Serverless Framework\\n  - HashiCorp-specific variables\\n  - configuration\\n  - deployment\\n-->\\n\\n# Resolvers\\n\\n- [HashiCorp Terraform State Outputs](terraform)\\n- [HashiCorp Vault Secrets](vault)\\n\\n\\nResult 14:\\nFileNode: {\\'basename\\': \\'README.md\\', \\'relative_path\\': \\'docs/guides/variables/aws/README.md\\', \\'node_id\\': 34404}\\npreview: <!--\\ntitle: Serverless Framework - Variables - AWS-specific variables\\ndescription: >-\\n  How to reference AWS-specific variables in the Serverless Framework for\\n  efficient configuration and deployment.\\nshort_title: Serverless Variables - AWS Variables\\nkeywords:\\n  - Serverless Framework\\n  - AWS-specific variables\\n  - configuration\\n  - deployment\\n  - accountId\\n  - region\\n-->\\n\\n# Resolvers\\n\\n- [AWS S3](s3)\\n- [AWS SSM Parameter Store & Secrets Manager](ssm)\\n- [AWS CloudFormation Outputs](cf-stack)\\n\\n# Configuration options\\n\\n| Option            | Required |  Type   |  Default  | Description                                                          |\\n| ----------------- | :------: | :-----: | :-------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| `accessKeyId`     |    No    | String  |           | AWS Access Key ID                                                    |\\n| `secretAccessKey` |    No    | String  |           | AWS Secret Access Key                                                |\\n| `sessionToken`    |    No    | String  |           | AWS Session Token                                                    |\\n| `region`          |    No    | String  | us-east-1 | AWS region                                                           |\\n| `profile`         |    No    | String  |           | AWS profile name                                                     |\\n| `dashboard`       |    No    | Boolean |   true    | Whether Serverless Dashboard AWS Provider credentials should be used |\\n\\n## Example\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  default:\\n    resolvers:\\n      aws-account-1:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: account1-profile-name\\n        region: us-west-2\\n        accessKeyId: ${env:ACCOUNT1_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}\\n        secretAccessKey: ${env:ACCOUNT1_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}\\n        dashboard: false\\n```\\n\\n# Provider-specific variables\\n\\nYou can reference AWS-specific values as the source of your variables.

It provides insights into the behavior, performance, and health of your services. The Serverless Framework allows you to automatically configure observability for your services.\\n\\n## Enabling Observability\\n\\nThe Serverless Framework supports multiple observability providers. You can configure it to work with your preferred provider using the `observability` property within the `stages` block in your `serverless.yml` file.\\nBelow is an example of how to enable the Serverless Dashboard observability feature for the `prod` stage:\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  prod:\\n    observability: dashboard\\n```\\n\\n## Configuring Observability\\n\\nFor more granular control, you can specify the observability key as an object and include additional properties. In this configuration, the `provider` key is required, and you must specify the desired provider.\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  prod:\\n    observability:\\n      provider: dashboard\\n      # additional configuration options for the chosen provider\\n      exampleSetting: customValue\\n```\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nLearn more about configuring and using our supported observability providers:\\n\\n- [Serverless Dashboard](./dashboard)\\n- [Axiom](./axiom)\\n\\n\\nResult 17:\\nFileNode: {\\'basename\\': \\'README.md\\', \\'relative_path\\': \\'docs/guides/dashboard/README.md\\', \\'node_id\\': 34439}\\npreview: <!--\\ntitle: Serverless Framework Dashboard - Setup & Overview\\ndescription: An overview and set-up guide for Serverless Framework Dashboard\\nshort_title: Serverless Dashboard - Setup & Overview\\nkeywords: [\\'Serverless Framework\\', \\'Dashboard\\', \\'Setup\\', \\'Overview\\']\\n-->\\n\\n<!-- DOCS-SITE-LINK:START automatically generated  -->\\n\\n### [Read this on the main serverless docs site](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/dashboard/)\\n\\n<!-- DOCS-SITE-LINK:END -->\\n\\n# Serverless Framework Dashboard\\n\\nThe [Serverless Framework Dashboard](https://app.serverless.com/) is a SaaS solution that augments the Serverless Framework CLI to provide a powerful, unified experience to develop, deploy, test, secure and monitor your serverless applications, across all AWS accounts.\\n\\nThe aim of the Serverless Framework and its Dashboard is to offer a seamless, integrated development experience for you and your team throughout the entire lifecycle of your serverless applications.

Review them all below. In 2025, we have begun releasing bigger projects, like the [Serverless Container Framework](https://github.com/serverless/containers), and the [Serverless MCP](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/mcp). As always, we are more excited about the serverless future than ever.\\n\\n## New Features In V.4\\n\\nHere\\'s a list of everything that\\'s new in V.4, so far:\\n\\n- **Improved Custom Domain Support:** You no longer need an external plugin to automatically configure custom domains and SSL certificates for your APIs and more. It\\'s now built into the [Serverless Framework CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/domains).\\n- **Integration with Doppler:** You can now easily fetch Secrets from Doppler via [Serverless Framework Variables](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/doppler).\\n- **Introducing [Serverless MCP](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/mcp):** Built for Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI-powered IDEs, it auto-detects cloud resources from your code, fetching logs, state, and config from AWS, enabling you to debug serverless apps directly in your IDE — no AWS console visit needed! Supports Serverless Framework, Cloudformation, and more.\\n- **Introducing the [Serverless Container Framework](https://github.com/serverless/containers):** One solution to deploy serverless workloads everywhere - This is a new YAML file that works with the Serverless Framework CLI that gives you one experience to easily deploy containers to AWS Lambda and AWS ECS Fargate and migrate between them w/ zero-downtime — all without re-architecting. We launched this as a way to reduce large Lambda bills and give folks flexibility, but it is rapidly become the greatest developer experience for containers on AWS. Support for Google Cloud Run, Azure and more are coming soon.\\n- **Support for AWS SAM, AWS Cloudformation, & Traditional Serverless Framework Projects:** Now, you can use one tool to deploy all three of these IaC project files. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/sam)\\n- **Native Typescript Support:** You can now use `.ts` handlers in your AWS Lambda functions in `serverless.yml` and have them build automatically upon deploy. [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) is now included in the Framework which makes this possible. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/building).\\n- **The AWS AI Stack:** V.4 is optimized for [the AWS AI Stack](https://github.com/serverless/aws-ai-stack). Deploy a full-stack, serverless, boilerplate for AI applications on AWS, featuring Bedrock LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama3.1 and much more.\\n- **New Dev Mode:** Run `serverless dev` to have events from your live architecture routed to your local code, enabling you to make fast changes without deployment. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/dev).\\n- - **Node.js V22:** Support for Node.js version 22 on AWS Lambda.\\n- **New Stages Property:** Easily organize stage-specific config via `stages` and set `default` config to fallback to.\\n- **Improved Compose Experience:** Serverless Compose now has a beautiful new CLI experience that better demonstrates what is being deployed.\\n- **New Terraform & Vault Integrations:** Pull state outputs from several Terraform state storage solutions, and secrets from Vault. [Terraform Docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/terraform) [Vault Docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/vault)\\n- **Support Command:** Send support requests to our team [directly from the CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/support), which auto-include contextual info which you can review before sending.\\n- **Debug Summary for AI:** When you run into a bug, you can run \"serverless support --ai\" to generate a concise report detailing your last bug with all necessary context, optimized for pasting into AI tools such as ChatGPT.\\n- **New AWS Lambda Runtimes:** \"python3.12\", \"dotnet8\", and \"java21\".\\n- **Advanced Logging Controls for AWS Lambda:** Capture Logs in JSON, increased log granularity, and setting a custom Log Group. Here is the [AWS article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-advanced-logging-controls-for-aws-lambda-functions/). Here is the [YAML implementation](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/v4.0/docs/providers/aws/guide/serverless.yml.md#logs)\\n- **Axiom Integration:** Integrate with [Axiom\\'s observability solution](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/observability/axiom) for a powerful logging, metrics and traces experience, at 3X less than AWS cloudwatch.\\n- **AWS SSO:** Environment variables, especially ones set by AWS SSO, are prioritized. The Framework and Dashboard no longer interfere with these.\\n- **Automatic Updates:** These happen by default now. Though, you will be able to control the level of updates you\\'re open to.\\n- **Improved Onboarding & Set-Up:** The `serverless` command has been re-written to be more helpful when setting up a new or existing project.\\n- **Updated Custom Resource Handlers:** All custom resource handlers now use `nodejs20.x`.\\n- **Deprecation Of Non-AWS Providers:** Deprecation of other cloud providers, in favor of handling this better in our upcoming Serverless Framework \"Extensions\".\\n\\n## Breaking Changes\\n\\nWe\\'re seeking to avoid breaking changes for the \"aws\" Provider. However, there are a few large things that are changing to be aware of:\\n\\n- The V.4 License is changing. See the section below for more information on this.\\n- Authentication is required within the CLI.\\n- Non-AWS Providers have been deprecated. We will be introducing new ways in V.4 to use other cloud infrastructure vendors.\\n\\nIf you stumble upon additional breaking changes, please create an issue. To learn more about what\\'s different and potential breaking changes, please see our [Upgrading to Serverless Framework V4 Documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/upgrading-v4).\\n\\n## License Changes in V.4\\n\\nPlease note, the structure and licensing of the V.4 repository differ from the V.4 npm module. The npm module contains some proprietary licensed software, as V.4 transitions to a common SaaS product, [as previously announced](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-framework-v4-a-new-model). The original Serverless Framework source code and more will continue to remain MIT license software, the repository will soon be restructured to clearly distinguish between proprietary and open-source components.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n# Contents\\n\\n- [Features](#features)\\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\\n- [Examples](https://github.com/serverless/examples)\\n- [Plugins](https://github.com/serverless/plugins)\\n- [Community](#community)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n# <a name=\"features\"></a>Features'}, {'FileNode': {'basename': 'README.md', 'relative_path': 'test/README.md', 'node_id': 15}, 'preview': \"# How to run, organize and write tests?\\n\\nAs framework deals with significant technical debt baggage many of currently configured tests do not\\nresemble practise we want to follow in newly introduced tests.\\n\\nPlease follow this document as the only guideline, it also provides links to tests that serve as a good example to replicate\\n\\n## Unit tests\\n\\nTests are configured with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test framework, and can be run with following command\\n\\n```\\nnpm test\\n```\\n\\nAll new tests should be configured with help of [runServerless](./utils/run-serverless.js) util - it's the only way to test functionality against completely intialized `serverless` instance, and it's the only scenario that reflects real world usage.\\n\\nCheck documentation of `runServerless` at [@serverless/test/docs/run-serverless](https://github.com/serverless/test/blob/main/docs/run-serverless.md#run-serverless). Note that `runServerless` as configured at `./utils/run-serverless.js` supports two additional options (`fixture` and `configExt`), which provides out of a box setup to run _Serverless_ instance against prepared fixture with eventually extended service configuration\\n\\nAs `runServerless` tests are expensive, it's good to ensure a _minimal_ count of `runServerless` runs to test given scope of problems. Ideally with one service example we should cover most of the test cases we can (good example of such approach is [ALB health check tests](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/80e70e7affd54418361c4d54bdef1561af6b8826/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/alb/lib/healthCheck.test.js#L18-L127))\\n\\nWhen creating a new test, it is an established practice to name the top-level describe after the path to the file, as shown in [AWS Kafka tests](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/b36cdf2db6ee25f7defe6f2c02dd40e1d5cb65c4/test/unit/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/kafka.test.js#L10).\\n\\n### Existing test examples:\\n\\n- [Run against config passed inline](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/73107822945a878abbdebe2309e8e9d87cc2858a/lib/plugins/aws/package/lib/generateCoreTemplate.test.js#L11-L14)\\n- [Run against preprepared fixture](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/74634c3317a116077a008375e20d6a5b99b1256e/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/functions/index.test.js#L2605-L2608)\\n  - Fixtures can be [extended](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/74634c3317a116077a008375e20d6a5b99b1256e/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/httpApi/index.test.js#L95-L99) on spot. Whenever possible it's better to extend existing fixture (e.g. basic `function`) instead of creating new one (check [ALB health check tests](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/80e70e7affd54418361c4d54bdef1561af6b8826/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/alb/lib/healthCheck.test.js) for good example on such approach)\\n  - If needed introduce new test fixtures at [test/fixtures](./fixtures)\\n\\nExample of test files fully backed by `runServerless`:\\n\\n- [lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/httpApi.js](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/main/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/events/httpApi.js)\\n\\nIf we're about to add new tests to an existing test file with tests written old way, then best is to create another `describe` block for new tests at the bottom (as it's done [here](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/main/test/unit/lib/plugins/aws/package/compile/functions.test.js#L1049))\\n\\n_Note: PR's which rewrite existing tests into new method are very welcome! (but, ideally each PR should cover single test file rewrite)_\\n\\n### Coverage\\n\\nWe aim for a (near) 100% test coverage, so make sure your tests cover as much of your code as possible.\\n\\nDuring development, you can easily check coverage by running `npm run coverage`, then opening the `index.html` file inside the `coverage` directory.\\n\\n## AWS Integration tests\\n\\nRun all tests via:\\n\\n```\\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx npm run integration-test-run-all\\n```\\n\\n_Note: Home folder is mocked for test run, therefore relying on `AWS_PROFILE` won't work. _ and _secret key_, need to be configured directly into env variables\\\\_\\n\\n_Note: Some integration tests depend on shared infrastructure stack (see below)_\\n\\nIdeally any feature that integrates with AWS functionality should be backed by integration test.\\n\\nCheck existing set of AWS integration tests at [test/integration](./integration)\\n\\n### Running specific integration test\\n\\nPass test file to Mocha directly as follows\\n\\n```\\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx npx mocha test/integration/{chosen}.test.js\\n```\\n\\n### Tests that depend on shared infrastructure stack\\n\\nDue to the fact that some of the tests require a bit more complex infrastructure setup which might be lengthy, two additional commands has been made available:\\n\\n- `integration-test-setup` - used for setting up all needed intrastructure dependencies\\n- `integration-test-teardown` - used for tearing down the infrastructure setup by the above command\\n\\nSuch tests take advantage of `isDependencyStackAvailable` util to check if all needed dependencies are ready.

With features like auto-scaling and no cost when idle, AWS Lambda offers a compute experience that demands so little maintenance it feels _\"serverless\"_.\\n\\nMonths later, the Serverless Framework was created to streamline the deployment of various use-cases on AWS Lambda. The Serverless Framework introduced the concept of _\"serverless architectures\"_, a transformative approach to building applications on the cloud, integrating AWS Lambda and cloud infrastructure with similar \"serverless\" qualities, to enable developers to create entire applications that scale massively with minimal maintenance.\\n\\nToday, the Serverless Framework continues to be the original, leading and most trusted tool for enterprises and start-ups building serverless architectures. Renowned Fortune 500 companies such as the _New York Times_, _Nike_, and _EA Games_ utilize it, while numerous startups have reached unicorn valuations and achieved notable exits using the Framework. These successes have been accomplished with relatively small engineering teams, leveraging the power of serverless architectures.\\n\\nThe mission of the Serverless Framework is to empower all developers to build more and manage less.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe Serverless Framework consists of a Command Line Interface and an optional Dashboard, and helps you deploy code and infrastructure together on Amazon Web Services, while increasingly supporting other cloud providers. The Framework is a YAML-based experience that uses simplified syntax to help you deploy complex infrastructure patterns easily, without needing to be a cloud expert. It is developed and maintained by Serverless Inc., a specialized software company based in San Francisco, California. Initially launched as an open-source project, the Framework has since transitioned to a SaaS product to better support its scalability and the extensive infrastructure capabilities it offers.\\n\\n## Highlights\\n\\n- **Empowerment:** Innovate faster by spending less time on infrastructure management.\\n- **Versatility:** Tackle diverse serverless use cases, from APIs and scheduled tasks to web sockets and data pipelines.\\n- **Infra & Code:** Streamline development with code and infrastructure deployment handled together.\\n- **Ease of Use:** Deploy complex applications without deep cloud infrastructure expertise, thanks to approachable YAML configuration.\\n- **Language Agnostic:** Develop in your preferred language – Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, PHP, Scala, or F# – the Framework supports them all.\\n- **Full Lifecycle:** Build, deploy, monitor, update, and troubleshoot serverless applications with ease.\\n- **Scalable Organization:** Structure large projects and teams efficiently with built-in support for stages and project composition.\\n- **Plugin Ecosystem:** Extend and modify the Framework\\'s functionality with a rich plugin ecosystem.\\n- **Vibrant Community:** Get support and connect with a passionate community of Serverless developers.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nGet started with the Serverless Framework on AWS [via this guide](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/).\\n\\nHave questions?

So you can\\'t use variables to generate dynamic logical IDs in the custom resources section for example.\\n\\n## Variable Resolvers\\n\\nVariable Resolvers allow you to reference external data sources in your serverless.yml file.\\nEach Resolver has a Provider parent, which is responsible for fetching the credentials.\\nFor example, the `aws` Provider has a `ssm` Resolver and a `s3` Resolver,\\nwhich can fetch data from AWS SSM Parameter Store and S3, respectively.\\n\\nProviders can also have default variables that can be used in the serverless.yml file,\\nsuch as `accountId` for the `aws` Provider.\\n\\nYou can customize Providers and Resolvers by specifying custom configuration options in the `resolvers` block of the `stages` section.\\nThen, you can reference the customized Resolvers using `${customProviderName:customResolverName:key}` syntax.\\n\\n**You can always reference the default Resolvers provided by Providers, even if you don’t define them explicitly.**\\nFor example,\\nyou can reference the default `s3` Resolver provided by the `aws` Provider using `${aws:s3:myBucket/myKey}` syntax\\n(it will use the AWS provider which provides the credentials for the deployment),\\nor `${customProviderName:s3:myBucket/myKey}` if you define customized Provider configuration.\\n\\n### Examples\\n\\n#### Default Resolvers\\n\\n```yaml\\nfunctions:\\n  hello:\\n    handler: handler.hello\\n    environment:\\n      ACCOUNT_ID: ${aws:accountId} # built-in variable provided by the AWS provider\\n      SSM_VALUE: ${aws:ssm:/path/to/param} # uses the default resolver configuration and the same AWS provider which is used for the deployment\\n      S3_VALUE: ${aws:s3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the default resolver configuration and the same AWS provider which is used for the deployment\\n```\\n\\n#### Customized Resolvers\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  default:\\n    resolvers:\\n      awsAccount1:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: dev-account1-profile-name\\n      awsAccount2:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: dev-account2-profile-name\\n        euS3: # custom resolver configuration defined for the awsAccount2 provider\\n          type: s3\\n          region: eu-west-1\\n  prod:\\n    resolvers:\\n      awsAccount1:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: prod-account1-profile-name\\n      awsAccount2:\\n        type: aws\\n        profile: prod-account2-profile-name\\n        euS3: # custom resolver configuration defined for the awsAccount2 provider\\n          type: s3\\n          region: eu-west-1\\n\\nfunctions:\\n  hello:\\n    handler: handler.hello\\n    environment:\\n      ACCOUNT1_ID: ${awsAccount1:accountId} # built-in variable provided by the AWS provider\\n      SSM_VALUE: ${awsAccount1:ssm:/path/to/param} # uses the default resolver configuration even if it\\'s not explicitly defined in the resolvers block\\n      EU_S3_VALUE: ${awsAccount2:euS3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the customized resolver configuration\\n      S3_VALUE: ${awsAccount2:s3:myBucket/myKey} # uses the default resolver configuration even if a customized one (euS3) is defined for the same provider\\n```\\n\\n## Supported Variable Providers:\\n\\n- [Self-References Properties Defined in `serverless.yml`](./self)\\n- [Serverless Core Variables](./core)\\n- [Environment Variables](./env-vars)\\n- [CLI Options](./cli-options)\\n- [External YAML/JSON Files](./file)\\n- [Dynamic Values from Javascript](./javascript)\\n- [Git](./git)\\n- [AWS](./aws)\\n- [HashiCorp](./hashicorp)\\n\\n## Recursively reference properties\\n\\nYou can also **recursively reference properties** with the variable system. This means you can combine multiple values and variable sources for a lot of flexibility.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```yml\\nprovider:\\n  name: aws\\n  environment:\\n    MY_SECRET: ${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}\\n```\\n\\nIf `sls deploy --stage qa` is run, the stage will be set to `qa`, which is used inside the `${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}` variable and it will resolve the `config.qa.json` file and use the `CREDS` key defined.\\n\\n**How that works:**\\n\\n1. `stage` is set to `qa` from the option supplied to the `sls deploy --stage qa` command. If no option is defined, then `${sls:stage}` will use the value in `provider.stage` or default to `dev` if not set.\\n2. `${sls:stage}` resolves to `qa` and is used in `${file(./config.${sls:stage}.json):CREDS}`\\n3. `${file(./config.qa.json):CREDS}` is found & the `CREDS` value is read\\n4. `MY_SECRET` value is set\\n\\nLikewise, if `sls deploy --stage prod` is run the `config.prod.json` file would be found and used.\\n\\n## Setting Variables using Parameters\\n\\nOccasionally you may want to set a variable directly in the `serverless.yml` that you can use throughout the file. In such a case you can use Parameters to set new variables or use them to set stage-specific variables.\\n\\nHere is an example of setting a domain variable based on the stage:\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  default:\\n    params:\\n      domain: ${sls:stage}.example-dev.com\\n  prod:\\n    params:\\n      domain: example.com\\n\\nprovider:\\n  environment:\\n    APP_DOMAIN: ${param:domain}\\n```\\n\\nRead all about parameters in the [Parameters documentation](../../guides/parameters.md).\\n\\n## Multiple Configuration Files\\n\\nAdding many custom resources to your `serverless.yml` file could bloat the whole file, so you can use the Serverless Variable syntax to split this up.\\n\\n```yml\\nresources:\\n  Resources: ${file(cloudformation-resources.json)}\\n```\\n\\nThe corresponding resources which are defined inside the `cloudformation-resources.json` file will be resolved and loaded into the `Resources` section.\\n\\nIn order to use multiple resource files combined with resources inside the `serverless.yml` you can use an array.\\n\\n```yml\\nresources:\\n  - Resources:\\n      ApiGatewayRestApi:\\n        Type: AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi\\n\\n  - ${file(resources/first-cf-resources.yml)}\\n  - ${file(resources/second-cf-resources.yml)}\\n\\n  - Outputs:\\n      CognitoUserPoolId:\\n      Value:\\n        Ref: CognitoUserPool\\n```\\n\\nEach of your cloudformation files has to start with a `Resources` entity\\n\\n```yml\\nResources:\\n  Type: \\'AWS::S3::Bucket\\'\\n  Properties:\\n    BucketName: some-bucket-name\\n```\\n\\n## Default values\\n\\nThe Serverless framework gives you an intuitive way to reference multiple variables as a fallback strategy in case one of the variables is missing. This way you\\'ll be able to use a default value from a certain source, if the variable from another source is missing.\\n\\nFor example, you can use the `opt` variable to get the `memory` CLI option when running `serverless deploy --memory 2048`.

It provides insights into the behavior, performance, and health of your services. The Serverless Framework allows you to automatically configure observability for your services.\\n\\n## Enabling Observability\\n\\nThe Serverless Framework supports multiple observability providers. You can configure it to work with your preferred provider using the `observability` property within the `stages` block in your `serverless.yml` file.\\nBelow is an example of how to enable the Serverless Dashboard observability feature for the `prod` stage:\\n\\n```yaml\\nstages:\\n  prod:\\n    observability: dashboard\\n```\\n\\n## Configuring Observability\\n\\nFor more granular control, you can specify the observability key as an object and include additional properties.

We hope it\\'s a breath of fresh air compared to the complexity of interacting with the AWS Console across several accounts, directly.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n- **Deployments:** Easily see all Serverless Framework deployments made by you and your team, via CI/CD or local installations of the CLI, across all of your AWS accounts, in one place. Quickly check who made the deployment, what the status is, how it may have failed, see git metadata, serverless.yml, outputs, and much more.\\n\\n- **Secrets:** Set and share secrets in one place, for use within your Serverless Framework `serverless.yml` files. This works across all AWS accounts, so it\\'s ideal for making secrets easy to use without wrestling with AWS permissions to access them. Secrets are encrypted and secure by default.\\n\\n- **Observability:** The richest and slickest observability solution for AWS Lambda on the market. We\\'ve spent years crafting an observability solution that developers love, specializing in AWS Lambda. Set-up requires zero effort and you will instantly get rich Metrics, Traces, Logs and Alerts, just deploy with the Serverless Framework. The Observability features also support non-Serverless Framework deployed AWS Lambda functions. Simply connect your AWS accounts and you\\'ll be able to instrument all of the AWS Lambda functions in them.\\n\\n- **Providers:** Providers make it easy to manage deployment access to your AWS accounts. Each Provider connects to 1 AWS account, and you can assign it to specific Services, Stages, or set a Provider as a default across an entire AWS account. This enables your team to never have to deal with local AWS credentials. Providers use an AWS IAM Role to connect to your account and provide short-term credentials for every deployment, which is more secure by default.\\n\\n- **CI/CD:** CI/CD optimized for Serverless Framework that works out-of-the-box. Simply connect it to Github or BitBucket to enable automated deployments. Set up preview deployments for branches, and much more.\\n\\n## Minimum Version Requirements\\n\\nTo use Serverless Framework Dashboard, you must be using Serverless Framework CLI version 1.48.0 or later.\\n\\nFor Serverless Framework\\'s new Observability offering, you must use version 3.35.0 or later.\\n\\n## Set-Up\\n\\nIf you don\\'t already have a Serverless Framework account, create a new account at [https://app.serverless.com](https://app.serverless.com).\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have existing Serverless Framework Services, follow the [Getting Started with the Serverless Framework and AWS](../../getting-started.md) guide. This will help you get a Serverless Framework Service deployed to AWS, and enabled with the Dashboard.\\n\\nIf you have existing Serverless Framework Services, in the directory with your Service\\'s `serverless.yml` file, run the `serverless` command. This will walk you through the setup process, including setting up your AWS account credentials and creating an organization and application from the Dashboard. Once completed, you\\'ll notice that the `org` and `app` fields will be added to your `serverless.yml` to indicate the org/app to which this service belongs.\\n\\nYou can also add the configuration manually to your `serverless.yml` files within your Serverless Framework Services to connect to the Dashboard.\\n\\n```YAML\\n\\norg: # Your Serverless Framework Org name (e.g. acme-inc)\\napp: # A parent namespce for this Service and related Services App name (e.g. mobile-app), to improve Serverless Framework Dashboard organization\\n\\n```\\n\\nYou must deploy your Service with the above configuration in your YAML file to have it show in the Dashboard. Run serverless deploy to do this.\\n\\nIf you want to enable Observability (metrics, traces, logs) for your AWS Lambda functions within Serverless Framework Dashboard, you will have to add the following in the stages block of your serverless.yml:\\n\\n```yml\\nstages:\\n  prod:\\n    observability: true # turn on observability in the \"prod\" Stage.\\n  dev:\\n    observability: true # turn on observability in the \"dev\" Stage.\\n  default:\\n    observability: false # turn off observability for all other Stages.\\n```\\n\\nTo set up Observability, Serverless Framework will automatically create an AWS IAM Role within the AWS account you deployed to, giving Serverless Inc permission to AWS Cloudwatch and more.

The permissions for this IAM Role are available in the [Dashboard Github Repo](https://github.com/serverless/dashboard), for your review.\\n\\nThere are two ways to connect your AWS account(s), _via Serverless Framework CLI_, and _via Serverless Framework Dashboard UI_.\\n\\nPlease note, enabling Serverless Framework\\'s Monitoring & Observability features will create a few resources on AWS accounts they\\'re connected to, adding minimal costs to your AWS accounts.\\n\\n### Set-Up Via Serverless Framework Dashboard UI\\n\\nThe most convenient way to set up Monitoring & Observability for multiple AWS accounts or accounts with many AWS Lambda functions is to do so via the Serverless Framework Dashboard UI.\\n\\nIn the navigation bar on the left, click on the \"Settings\" icon, and then click on the \"Integrations\" tab. Here is where you connect AWS accounts.\\n\\nIn a separate browser window, log into the AWS Account via the browser that you wish to connect to. You will need to have permission to create IAM Roles with the [required permissions](https://github.com/serverless/dashboard) for Monitoring & Observability.\\n\\nIn the \"Integrations\" view, click the \"Add Integrations\" button. This launches a quick process that opens a new browser window containing AWS Console\\'s AWS CloudFormation Stack Create view. This window is pre-loaded with an AWS CloudFormation Stack Template that contains an AWS IAM Role with all of the permissions Serverless Framework\\'s Monitoring & Observability features need. At the bottom of this page, click \"Create\".\\n\\nWhile the CloudFormation Stack is creating, go back to the Serverless Framework Dashboard. The Integration view should have detected your Stack is being created and this view will continue to update in real-time until the integration is completed. No other steps are required on your behalf.\\n\\nRepeat this step to connect as many AWS accounts that you\\'d like to enable Monitoring & Observability for.\\n\\nOnce an AWS account is connected, you will need to choose the AWS Lambda functions you wish to enable Monitoring & Observability on. You should see a newly created AWS Integration in the \"Integrations\" view. We recommend giving that AWS Account a name (e.g. \"production\", \"development\") so it\\'s easier to remember and find in Dashboard\\'s query filters. On the Integration, click the \"Edit\" button, and you will see all of the AWS Lambda functions within that AWS account.\\n\\nClick the \"Instrument\" toggle on individual AWS Lambda functions, or click the toggle in the table header to enable instrumentation on all of the functions within that page (you\\'ll have to repeat this on each page if you have multiple pages of AWS Lambda functions). Click \"Save\". This will instrument the AWS Lambda functions in the background. You can go through each page and continue to instrument AWS Lambda functions since instrumentation happens asynchronously.\\n\\nGo to the Metrics or Explorer view. Make sure your AWS Lambda functions are being invoked. After a few minutes, you should see data appear.\\n\\nPlease note, Metrics, Traces and more typically can take up to 10 minutes before they are visible in Serverless Framework Dashboard, after an AWS account has been integrated.\\n\\n### Set-Up Via Serverless Framework CLI\\n\\nYou can use the Serverless Framework CLI to enable Monitoring & Observability. This approach will automatically connect the Serverless Framework Platform to an AWS account and enable monitoring on all of the AWS Lambda functions for the selected stages within the Serverless Framework Service.\\n\\nHowever, if you want to connect multiple AWS accounts and/or enable monitoring on all AWS Lambda functions within an AWS account, setting it up via the Serverless Framework Dashboard UI is more convenient, as you can accomplish this in a few clicks.\\n\\nWithin the working directory of a Serverless Framework Service, ensure the Service is first connected to the Serverless Framework Dashboard. This can be confirmed by the presence of an org and app properties within the serverless.yml file. If the Service is not connected to the Dashboard, run the `serverless` command within the working directory of the Serverless Framework Service. Once your service is connected to the Serverless Dashboard, you can control your observability instrumentation settings under the stages property in your serverless.yml file:\\n\\n```yml\\n# Ensure these properties are present to connect to the Dashboard\\norg: my-org\\napp: my-app\\n\\n# Control observability instrumentation settings under stages\\nstages:\\n  dev:\\n    observability: true # Turn on observability in the dev stage\\n  prod:\\n    observability: true # Turn on observability in the prod stage\\n  default:\\n    observability: false # Turn off observability in all other stages\\n```\\n\\nNow, whenever you deploy, observability will be enabled or disabled according to the stage you are deploying to. In the above example, observability will be enabled in the dev and prod stages but disabled in all other stages.\\n\\nAfter deployment, confirm everything worked within the Serverless Framework Dashboard. Go to \"Settings\" > \"Integrations,\" and you should see the AWS account that was recently integrated. We highly recommend giving that account a name so it\\'s easier to remember and find in the Dashboard\\'s query filters.\\n\\nIf you click on the \"Edit\" button on that Integration, you should see all of the AWS Lambda functions in the account, indicating which ones are enabled and which are disabled.\\n\\nPlease note, Metrics, Traces and more typically can take up to 10 minutes before they are visible in Serverless Framework Dashboard, after an AWS account has been integrated.\\n\\n## Advanced Instrumentation Using The SDK\\n\\nIn addition to the out-of-the-box instrumentation provided by Serverless Framework Dashboard, you can customize instrumentation using the Serverless SDK for richer use cases, such as:\\n\\n- Capturing handled errors so that they are reported elegantly in Serverless Framework Dashboard.\\n- Capturing custom Trace Spans.\\n- Capturing Error and Warnings Events.\\n- Adding Custom Tags to Traces for better searchability.\\n- Integrating with structured logging libraries.\\n\\nSee the SDK documentation for Node and Python for details:\\n\\n- [Full NodeJS Documentation](./sdk/nodejs.md)\\n- [Full Python Documentation](./sdk/python.md)\\n\\n## Supported AWS Lambda Runtimes\\n\\nServerless Framework\\'s Monitoring & Observability features currently support the following AWS Lambda Runtimes:\\n\\n- nodejs14.x\\n- nodejs16.x\\n- nodejs18.x\\n- python3.8\\n- python3.9\\n- python3.10\\n- python3.11\\n\\n## Supported AWS Regions\\n\\nServerless Framework\\'s Monitoring & Observability features currently support all of the Commercial AWS Regions. They do not support GovCloud or reginos in China.\\n\\n## How Integration Works\\n\\nServerless Framework\\'s Monitoring & Observability features use a few approaches to thoroughly collect all Metrics, Traces, Errors and more from your AWS Lambda functions. This is all done via an AWS IAM Role that is created when you integrate your AWS account with Serverless Framework\\'s Platform. The permissions for this AWS IAM Role are kept in [Github here](https://github.com/serverless/dashboard), so that you can easily review what\\'s required. You can remove this IAM Role at any time. But we recommend hitting \"Remove\" on the Integration within the Dashboard because it will automatically un-instrument the AWS account and AWS Lambda functions, in addition to deleting the IAM Role.\\n\\nThe first thing an AWS account integration does is create a Kinesis Firehose within your AWS account connected to a Cloudwatch Logs Subscription to each of your AWS Lambda functions which publish logs into that Firehose. The Serverless Framework Platform ingests log data from that Kinesis Firehose. This helps us collect Logs and more from your AWS Lambda functions. During each invocation, the Serverless Framework logs a compressed payload containing Trace information within your AWS Cloudwatch Logs. This can be identified easily because it starts with `SERVERLESS_TELEMETRY`.'}, {'FileNode': {'basename': 'README.md', 'relative_path': 'docs/guides/dashboard/monitoring/sdk/README.md', 'node_id': 34456}, 'preview': \"<!--\\ntitle: Serverless Framework - Monitoring & Observability - SDKs\\ndescription: Learn how to use the Serverless Framework SDK for monitoring and observability in your serverless applications.\\nshort_title: Serverless Observability - SDK\\nkeywords:\\n  [\\n    'Serverless Framework',\\n    'SDK',\\n    'Monitoring',\\n    'Observability',\\n    'Lambda',\\n    'Instrumentation',\\n  ]\\n-->\\n\\n<!-- DOCS-SITE-LINK:START automatically generated  -->\\n\\n### [Read this on the main serverless docs site](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/sdk/)\\n\\n<!-- DOCS-SITE-LINK:END -->\\n\\n# Serverless Framework SDK\\n\\nWhen using the Serverless Framework Dashboard, the Framework automatically injects the `serverless_sdk` module into your lambda package and wraps your lambda to automatically instrument all the monitoring features in the Dashboard.\\n\\nIt also has certain features you can use directly in your lambda such as capturing an error in the Dashboard without causing your lambda to error and custom function spans.\\n\\n[NodeJS Documentation](./nodejs.md)\\n\\n[Python Documentation](./python.md)\\n\\n## Advanced Span Configuration\\n\\nFor most of the SDK configuration, like turning on/off span collection, follow the\\n[Monitoring Configuration](../README.md/#configuration) instructions to modify your\\nserverless.yml appropriately.\\n\\nIf needed, you can configure HTTP span collection with the following environment variables\\n\\n- `SERVERLESS_ENTERPRISE_SPANS_CAPTURE_HOSTS` - `*` by default.

Currently Github and BitBucket are supported as a VCS providers. Your project, including the serverless.yml file, must be checked into a repo.\\n2. **Must be deployed on AWS**. The dashboard currently only supports AWS as a cloud service provider. Other cloud service providers are a work in progress.\\n3. **Must use the Node or Python runtime**. Currently only Serverless Framework projects using the Node or Python runtimes are supported. Other runtimes may work but are not officially supported.\\n\\n## Getting Started in 3 steps\\n\\n### Step 1: Link your AWS Account\\n\\nAs is the case with deployments from the Serverless Framework CLI, Serverless CI/CD requires access to your AWS Account in order to deploy your services. To make this process as secure as possible, Serverless CI/CD will generate short-lived credentials to your AWS account on each deployment. This is done by creating an AWS Access Role in your AWS account and associating it with a Provider in the Serverless Framework Dashboard.\\n\\nIf you’ve already set up an AWS Access Role with a Provider, you can skip this step. Otherwise, please go through the instructions on our [Provider documentation page](../dashboard/providers.md) to help set one up.\\n\\n### Step 2: Connect to Github\\n\\n1. Login to [https://app.serverless.com/](https://app.serverless.com/).\\n2. Navigate to the app which contains the service you want to deploy and click the menu icon (...) on the right hand side and choose \"settings\"\\n3. In the “connect to git” section, click “connect to Github” or \"connect to BitBucket\" and follow the instructions to authenticate and install the Serverless Framework app.\\n4. In the “repository settings” section, select the repository and base directory if needed containing your service. The service name specified in the serverless.yml must match the service you are configuring.\\n5. In the \"branch deploys\" section, you can choose to map a specific branch in your repo to the correct stage. When code is merged to that branch it then deploys using that stage and its associated Provider (and parameters).\\n6. Changes will be automatically saved when you make them\\n\\nThat’s it! You do not have to create any configuration files in your repository or define your test commands or your\\ndeployment commands.\\n\\nYour service will now deploy from the master branch and you’ll see all the test results, logs, safeguard pass/fail\\nstatus, and deployment details.\\n\\n### Step 3: Deploy from a Github branch\\n\\nNow that you are setup to deploy all changes to the master branch to the dev stage for your service, go ahead and make a\\ncommit and navigate to “deployments” in the dashboard.

Review them all below. In 2025, we have begun releasing bigger projects, like the [Serverless Container Framework](https://github.com/serverless/containers), and the [Serverless MCP](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/mcp). As always, we are more excited about the serverless future than ever.\n39. \n40. ## New Features In V.4\n41. \n42. Here's a list of everything that's new in V.4, so far:\n43. \n44. - **Improved Custom Domain Support:** You no longer need an external plugin to automatically configure custom domains and SSL certificates for your APIs and more. It's now built into the [Serverless Framework CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/domains).\n45. - **Integration with Doppler:** You can now easily fetch Secrets from Doppler via [Serverless Framework Variables](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/doppler).\n46. - **Introducing [Serverless MCP](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/mcp):** Built for Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI-powered IDEs, it auto-detects cloud resources from your code, fetching logs, state, and config from AWS, enabling you to debug serverless apps directly in your IDE — no AWS console visit needed! Supports Serverless Framework, Cloudformation, and more.\n47. - **Introducing the [Serverless Container Framework](https://github.com/serverless/containers):** One solution to deploy serverless workloads everywhere - This is a new YAML file that works with the Serverless Framework CLI that gives you one experience to easily deploy containers to AWS Lambda and AWS ECS Fargate and migrate between them w/ zero-downtime — all without re-architecting. We launched this as a way to reduce large Lambda bills and give folks flexibility, but it is rapidly become the greatest developer experience for containers on AWS. Support for Google Cloud Run, Azure and more are coming soon.\n48. - **Support for AWS SAM, AWS Cloudformation, & Traditional Serverless Framework Projects:** Now, you can use one tool to deploy all three of these IaC project files. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/sam)\n49. - **Native Typescript Support:** You can now use `.ts` handlers in your AWS Lambda functions in `serverless.yml` and have them build automatically upon deploy. [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) is now included in the Framework which makes this possible. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/building).\n50. - **The AWS AI Stack:** V.4 is optimized for [the AWS AI Stack](https://github.com/serverless/aws-ai-stack). Deploy a full-stack, serverless, boilerplate for AI applications on AWS, featuring Bedrock LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama3.1 and much more.\n51. - **New Dev Mode:** Run `serverless dev` to have events from your live architecture routed to your local code, enabling you to make fast changes without deployment. [More info here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/dev).\n52. - - **Node.js V22:** Support for Node.js version 22 on AWS Lambda.\n53. - **New Stages Property:** Easily organize stage-specific config via `stages` and set `default` config to fallback to.\n54. - **Improved Compose Experience:** Serverless Compose now has a beautiful new CLI experience that better demonstrates what is being deployed.\n55. - **New Terraform & Vault Integrations:** Pull state outputs from several Terraform state storage solutions, and secrets from Vault. [Terraform Docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/terraform) [Vault Docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/variables/vault)\n56. - **Support Command:** Send support requests to our team [directly from the CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/support), which auto-include contextual info which you can review before sending.\n57. - **Debug Summary for AI:** When you run into a bug, you can run \"serverless support --ai\" to generate a concise report detailing your last bug with all necessary context, optimized for pasting into AI tools such as ChatGPT.\n58. - **New AWS Lambda Runtimes:** \"python3.12\", \"dotnet8\", and \"java21\".\n59. - **Advanced Logging Controls for AWS Lambda:** Capture Logs in JSON, increased log granularity, and setting a custom Log Group. Here is the [AWS article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-advanced-logging-controls-for-aws-lambda-functions/). Here is the [YAML implementation](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/v4.0/docs/providers/aws/guide/serverless.yml.md#logs)\n60. - **Axiom Integration:** Integrate with [Axiom's observability solution](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/observability/axiom) for a powerful logging, metrics and traces experience, at 3X less than AWS cloudwatch.\n61. - **AWS SSO:** Environment variables, especially ones set by AWS SSO, are prioritized. The Framework and Dashboard no longer interfere with these.\n62. - **Automatic Updates:** These happen by default now. Though, you will be able to control the level of updates you're open to.\n63. - **Improved Onboarding & Set-Up:** The `serverless` command has been re-written to be more helpful when setting up a new or existing project.\n64. - **Updated Custom Resource Handlers:** All custom resource handlers now use `nodejs20.x`.\n65. - **Deprecation Of Non-AWS Providers:** Deprecation of other cloud providers, in favor of handling this better in our upcoming Serverless Framework \"Extensions\".\n66. \n67. ## Breaking Changes\n68. \n69. We're seeking to avoid breaking changes for the \"aws\" Provider. However, there are a few large things that are changing to be aware of:\n70. \n71. - The V.4 License is changing. See the section below for more information on this.\n72. - Authentication is required within the CLI.\n73. - Non-AWS Providers have been deprecated. We will be introducing new ways in V.4 to use other cloud infrastructure vendors.\n74. \n75. If you stumble upon additional breaking changes, please create an issue. To learn more about what's different and potential breaking changes, please see our [Upgrading to Serverless Framework V4 Documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/upgrading-v4).\n76. \n77. ## License Changes in V.4\n78. \n79. Please note, the structure and licensing of the V.4 repository differ from the V.4 npm module. The npm module contains some proprietary licensed software, as V.4 transitions to a common SaaS product, [as previously announced](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-framework-v4-a-new-model). The original Serverless Framework source code and more will continue to remain MIT license software, the repository will soon be restructured to clearly distinguish between proprietary and open-source components.\n80. \n81. <br/>\n82. \n83. # Contents\n84. \n85. - [Features](#features)\n86. - [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n87. - [Examples](https://github.com/serverless/examples)\n88. - [Plugins](https://github.com/serverless/plugins)\n89. - [Community](#community)\n90. \n91. <br/>\n92. \n93. # <a name=\"features\"></a>Features\n",

We will be introducing new ways in V.4 to use other cloud infrastructure vendors.\\n74. \\n75. If you stumble upon additional breaking changes, please create an issue. To learn more about what\\'s different and potential breaking changes, please see our [Upgrading to Serverless Framework V4 Documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/upgrading-v4).\\n76. \\n77. ## License Changes in V.4\\n78. \\n79. Please note, the structure and licensing of the V.4 repository differ from the V.4 npm module. The npm module contains some proprietary licensed software, as V.4 transitions to a common SaaS product, [as previously announced](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-framework-v4-a-new-model). The original Serverless Framework source code and more will continue to remain MIT license software, the repository will soon be restructured to clearly distinguish between proprietary and open-source components.\\n80. \\n81. <br/>\\n82. \\n83. # Contents\\n84. \\n85. - [Features](#features)\\n86. - [Quick Start](#quick-start)\\n87. - [Examples](https://github.com/serverless/examples)\\n88. - [Plugins](https://github.com/serverless/plugins)\\n89. - [Community](#community)\\n90. \\n91. <br/>\\n92. \\n93. # <a name=\"features\"></a>Features\\n\\n\\n\\nNow generate a complete executable bash script that can successfully set up and configure the environment for this project, especially designed to run inside Docker containers. The bash script should:\\n1. Install the appropriate runtime and dependencies for the project\\'s technology stack\\n2. Install all necessary system packages and tools\\n3. Set up the project directory structure and permissions\\n4. Configure the runtime environment properly\\n5. Set up necessary environment variables and configurations\\n6. Follow bash scripting best practices for error handling and security\\n\\nMake sure the bash script is self-contained and can set up the project environment from scratch in a Docker container environment.\\n' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={} id='dbce88b6-d9a1-4a70-a57e-7102b2529e45'",
